<h3>ACT I</h3>


<p class="negidt"><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <em>A vast room in the palace of Hudibrand. As the curtain rises the
place is in darkness save for a circlet of gold apparently suspended in
mid-air near the centre of the room. As the light increases, the outline
of a man's figure becomes distinguishable, and the circlet is seen to be
resting on his head. Gradually the rim of gold fades to invisibility,
while the figure of the man and the contents of the room become clear to
the eye. The man might be mistaken for an American citizen in customary
evening dress. He is Hudibrand.</em></p>

<p class="negidt"><em>At the left are two entrances, upper and lower. Rear, left, large
windows. The wall rear makes a right angle about centre, the apex of
which is cut off by a window. Right of centre the room seems to extend
endlessly rearward, and is arranged to suggest an upland grove in the
delicate, venturing days of spring. The ground, rising a little toward
right, is covered with winter moss and tufts of short silvered grass.
The trees are young birch, slight maples in coral leaf, cornel in
flower, and an occasional dark foil of cedar. A brooklet ripples down
the slope and off rear. Birds chirp and flit, and now and then a breeze
stirs the grove as if it were one tender body. The lights are arranged
to give the effect of night or day as one wishes.</em></p>

<p class="negidt"><em>It is winter without, the climate of Assaria's capital city being
similar to that of New York.</em></p>

<p class="negidt"><em>Double doors lower right, through which Count Dorkinski enters to
Hudibrand.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dor.</em> Your majesty, Sir Borduc has arrived.</p>

<p><em>Hudi.</em> Hot-shod. We'll let him cool.</p>

<p><em>Dor.</em>           <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Where shall he wait,</span><br />
My lord?</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> His usual corner. Keep him off<br />
My Delhi rug.<br />

    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<em>Exit Dorkinski</em>]</span><br />

    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor Bordy's fuming ripe.</span></p>

<p class="center">[<em>Re-enter the Count</em>]</p>

<p><em>Dor.</em> His Excellency calls, your majesty.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Which Excellency? They are thick as hops.</p>

<p><em>Dor.</em> The Governor of Peonia.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>  &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">In time and tune.</span><br />
We'll see him here.<br />

    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<em>Exit Dorkinski</em>]</span><br />

    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">A pawn of mine who'd push</span><br />
Beyond his square, and I must humor him<br />
'Neath meditative thumb.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Enter Megario</em>]</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Welcome, Megario.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I've travelled far</span><br />
To press your hand.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">We made appointment here,</span><br />
Knowing your visit to Assaria touched<br />
Nothing of state or office.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> [<em>Accepting his cue</em>] Nothing, sir. [<em>Looks about him</em>]<br />
I thought I left the springtide in my rear,<br />
Three thousand miles or so, but here it greets me.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> A gimcrack of my daughter's. She would freak<br />
With sun and time. My toyshop has no walls.<br />
I juggle too with seasons, climates, zones,<br />
But in the open where there's warrior room,<br />
And startled Fate may spring against my will,<br />
Giving an edge to mastery when I wrest<br />
The whip from Nature, turn it on herself,<br />
And set her elemental slaves to filch<br />
Her gold for me. That, friend, is play.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">For gods</span><br />
And not as thief, but as divinity,<br />
You take from crouching Nature.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Men have said</span><br />
I pile up gold because its glitter soothes<br />
A fever in my eyes. The clacking fools!<br />
I am no Cheops making warts on earth.<br />
No mummy brain! God built my pyramids,<br />
Slaving through dark and chaos till there rose<br />
My iron-hearted hills, and mountains locked<br />
On ago-unyielded treasure waiting me.<br />
There slept my gems till longing became fire<br />
And broke the grip of stone,&mdash;there lay my gold,<br />
Re-purged each thousand years till baited Time<br />
Gave up the master's hour.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Hernda has come from the grove and moves up to his side</em>]</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Adoringly</em>] And you the master!</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Daughter, you owe my lord Megario<br />
Some pretty thanks.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I give them, sir.</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">No, no!</span><br />
I pray your Highness, no! My thanks to earth<br />
That bears the flower of you, and to the light<br />
That makes my eyes your beauty's treasurer.<br />
But thanks from you to me, as jewels hung<br />
Upon a beggar's neck, would set my rags<br />
Unkindly in the sun.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>  &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Then I am not</span><br />
Your debtor?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mine the debt, that mounts too fast</span><br />
For feeble payment from thin purse of words.<br />
Ah, every moment adds a suitor hope<br />
To th' bankrupts in my heart.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I fear, my lord,</span><br />
Your coiner's name is Fancy, and I like<br />
Truth's mintage best. [<em>To her father</em>]<br />
&nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">What is this debt of mine,</span><br />
So languished that a word of thanks may be<br />
Its slender cover?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">A word, if beauty speak it,</span><br />
May mantle a bare world.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">His Excellency</span><br />
Is Governor of Peonia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">In Goldusan!</span></p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> And smoothed my road there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Nay, your majesty,</span><br />
My aid was but a garnish on the might<br />
That moves with your own name.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Between us then,</span><br />
We saved my holdings through a bluster there.<br />
And what they brought me I've tossed here to make<br />
This smile on winter.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">What? You gave her all?</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> How, sir? One word of mine would robe a world.<br />
And my whole self not worth a little spot<br />
Twitched from Spring's garment?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Oh, I'd grind the stars</span><br />
To imperial dust that you might trample them,&mdash;<br />
But this&mdash;this was a <em>fortune</em>!<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<em>To Hudibrand</em>] Sir, 'tis true</span><br />
You care not for the gold.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I care for it</span><br />
As men of hero times held dear the sword<br />
That made them lords of battle.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">You are lord</span><br />
Of Peace!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Write that upon the clouds, that eyes<br />
Of men and angels may contending claim<br />
The truth for earth and heaven!</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Tush, sir, tush!</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Can I forget how at your kingly touch<br />
My fair Peonia, paling in treason's grip,<br />
Thrilled from her deathward droop, renewed her heart<br />
Through safe, ease-lidded nights, and woke once more<br />
The rose of fortune?</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">There's no rumble now</span><br />
Of riot?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Not a sound comes to our ears<br />
But from the toiling strokes that steadily<br />
Uproll Peonia's wealth.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Yet those who led</span><br />
The last revolt are free.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Not all, your Highness.</span><br />
A few crossed to Assaria, but expedition<br />
Warms on their trail. Rejan LeVal is tracked<br />
To your own capital.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Nay, mend that, sir.</span><br />
We're safe here from such ruck.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">The startled eel</span><br />
Will make for muddy waters,&mdash;and 'tis sure<br />
LeVal found murky welcome here.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">My city!</span><br />
What mutinous bolt turns here for him?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>  &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">His friends</span><br />
Are friends of power. How else could he elude<br />
The thousand eyes in search?</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> [<em>Musing</em>]    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Treason at court?...</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> We'll mouse LeVal to 's cranny, do not doubt.<br />
Then we shall ask Assaria's great seal<br />
For his delivery to Goldusan.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> That is assured you.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">But your minister,</span><br />
Sir Borduc, warns&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ha! Warns?</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">He urges that</span><br />
The extraditing power is at pause,<br />
Blocked by the people's will.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I've given my word,&mdash;</span><br />
A word that mobbish din ne'er added to,<br />
Nor yet stripped of one letter that I chose<br />
Should spell authority. You ask for more?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Pardon, your majesty! It is enough,<br />
Beyond all stretch of need.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I call to mind</span><br />
That Borduc waits,&mdash;and primed for tongue-work too.<br />
The princess will content your Excellency?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> [<em>With obeisance to Hernda</em>] 'Tis Heaven's honor!
I have left the earth!</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> You waste your art. She's in the milk-maid humor.<br />
Would marry Hob. [<em>Exit, lower right</em>]</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> The Se&ntilde;or Hob? He says<br />
You'll marry him? [<em>Hernda laughs</em>]<br />
&nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You care not if I die!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You'll live, my lord.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> You'll marry Hob. I die!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> He is not Hob. That is my father's mock<br />
Because he's poor.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> [<em>In hope</em>] Ah, poor?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">A beggarly</span><br />
Ten millions,&mdash;not a penny more.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Ten millions!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> But that's my joy. I would not wed for gold.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> O, pity me! I love you, se&ntilde;orita!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> No, no! I must not hear that.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Then I'll pray</span><br />
Silence to be my friend and speak my dumb<br />
Unuttered heart.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">You must not love me, sir.</span><br />
But you may love&mdash;my father. When you praised him,<br />
You too seemed fair to me.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I'll sing him till</span><br />
The stars lie at our feet, if you will listen!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> He gave your country peace?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">His royal name</span><br />
Is dear as Cordiaz' in the grateful heart<br />
Of Goldusan. That proud land lay unkept.<br />
Her ores intombed, her vales without a plough,<br />
Her rivers wasting down to shipless seas,<br />
Her people starving, while her nobles strove<br />
For shreds of power,&mdash;the clouted thing we called<br />
A government. Then on our factions fell,<br />
Strong as a god's, the hand of Hudibrand;<br />
And now, compact, we stand by Cordiaz,<br />
While every mountain groans with golden birth.<br />
And every river turns its thousand wheels,<br />
And every valley buried is in bloom.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> My dearest father! But I knew 'twas so!<br />
And they who starved are fed and happy now?<br />
They reap the bloom and share the golden flood?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> All will be well when once we've scourged the land<br />
Of rebels that drip poison from their tongues,<br />
Stirring the meek and unambitious poor,&mdash;<br />
Who sought no life but saintly, noble toil,&mdash;<br />
With strangest rage, till maddened they would bite<br />
The fostering hand of God.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">We've prisons where</span><br />
We put such troublers. Has your land no jails?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>'Tis full of them! I mean&mdash;ah, we have jails,<br />
But foes like these are wary, slip all watch,&mdash;<br />
Flee and dart back, our weariness their charter<br />
To tread with havoc's hoof. If I could find<br />
Rejan LeVal, then might I rest from guard,<br />
But not while he&mdash;unlassoed warrigal!&mdash;<br />
May canter from his thicket and paw up<br />
Peonia's fields!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I'll lend an adjutant.</span><br />

<p><em>Meg.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Chartrien! Nay, the fox is safe<br />
When th' hound too wears a brush.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">You mean the prince?</span><br />
Speak, sir! Who hints me calumny,<br />
Shall make the drum his chorus. I'll hear all.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> A rumor drifts through Goldusan....</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 14em;">Is that</span><br />
An oddity? Here rumors are too thick<br />
For ears to gather them.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> But this&mdash;O, princess....<br />
Fairest of earth, forgive me that I speak!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You do not speak. And that I'll not forgive.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Ah, then,&mdash;but first,&mdash;is Chartrien near the king?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> No nearer than his heart.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">I do offend.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Offence now lies in silence. Speak, my lord.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> When I left Goldusan, 'twas said&mdash;and with<br />
No muffled hesitance&mdash;Prince Chartrien aids<br />
The rebels there, and lays a train to rend<br />
The State apart, that Cordiaz may drop<br />
Into the gap,&mdash;then he with plausive cleat<br />
Will make the fissure stanch, and seat himself<br />
In unoppugn&egrave;d power.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Why <em>he is Hob</em>! [<em>Silence. They both rise</em>]</span><br />

<p><em>Meg.</em>           <span style="margin-left: 9em;">I see.</span><br />
He's in the capital?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Beneath this roof.</span><br />
The palace is his home. My father holds<br />

<p><em>Her.</em> <span style="margin-left: 11em;">To-night.</span><br />
He's with a friend&mdash;a Spanish gentleman,&mdash;<br />
But <em>not</em> from Goldusan.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I made no guess.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Deny that with your eyes. Your tongue's exempt.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">O, Chartrien, are you mine? I feel</span><br />

Made invoice of its treasure. Once you rushed<br />

<p><em>Hud.</em> And find what lodestar there draws Chartrien<br />
From constancy? Well, you shall go.</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Tut, tut!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Dear father!</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> This will give domestic screen<br />
And color to our tack.</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>    &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">A gadding throne&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Good Borduc, we will leave the throne at home.<br />
Do not <em>you</em> stay?</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em> I've some authority,<br />
You'll not dispute, my lord. Much as may go<br />
With broad election. My investiture<br />
Lies in the people's choice.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Ay, you're their bark<br />
Of freedom, where their pride may hoist full sail,<br />
But who wots better, Bordy, that 'tis puffed<br />
With winds that know my port?</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em> They think their choice<br />
Is free. Sincere in that, they give my post<br />
A dignity not even your majesty<br />
May mock me out of.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Fools are noted most</span><br />
For their sincerity,&mdash;a virtue that<br />
Must stand a cipher if uncertified<br />
By wit or wisdom.</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sir, Assarians</span><br />
Are not the fools you think them. They are men<br />
Who have the patriot's heart, and on their flag<br />
Where you write "power" their love reads "liberty."</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> It does, praise be! And they may keep their flag<br />
To wear around their eyes long as they will.<br />
For then I dance my measure, while they bump<br />
In hither-whither hoodman blind and pay<br />
My fiddler too!</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And what's my part in this?</span></p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> The fiddler's, Borduc.</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Sir?</span></p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">And your next tune</span><br />
Is Goldusan. Come, let's rehearse.</p>

<p><em>Bor.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">My lord,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Exeunt, lower right, as Chartrien and LeVal enter left</em>]</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You've come, dear Se&ntilde;or! Was it savagery<br />
To wrest the hour from you?</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Too kindly done</span><br />
For such a name,&mdash;though I was deep in bond<br />
To sober thoughts, your Highness.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Be so still.</span><br />
We would not force our humor on your heart,<br />
But share your own.</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> [<em>Smiling</em>] Can you be sad?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">As rains</span><br />
That drench October. As the gray<br />
That fringes twilight on the dark of moons.<br />
As seas that sob above a swallowed ship,<br />
Repenting storm. [<em>Leads to seat, right</em>]<br />
&nbsp;      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Come, sir,&mdash;and I'll be sad</span><br />
In what degree you choose, though I could wish it<br />
Nearer a smile than rheum, and not so heavy<br />
But that its sigh may float upon a song,<br />
A gentle song that might be sorrow's garland<br />
When moan wears down. Wilt hear one now, my lord?<br />
I have a music-maker yon whose lute<br />
Was nectared in a poet's tears the hour<br />
He lost his dream. Say you will hear him! Nay,<br />
That courtier "yes" can not o'ertake the "no"<br />
Sped from your eyes. We'll have no music. Yet<br />
The soul must love it ere one can be sad<br />
To th' very sweet of sadness. O, I know!</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> I love it, but not here.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">What here forbids?</span><br />
My bower! The eye translates its tenderness<br />
To fairy sound, nor need of pipe or strings.</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> I can not hear the bells of fairydom<br />
When life is making thunder's music 'gainst<br />
This bauble house of play&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Rising</em>]   &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Sir, you forget&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> Nay, I remember!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">What do you remember?</span></p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> Ah!... Pardon, princess!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">May I mend this peace?</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Sitting again by LeVal</em>] It is not broken yet.</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 17em;">Your gentleness</span><br />
Has saved it, not my manners.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Oh, my lord,</span><br />
Would I had grace to cover sorrow's breach<br />
As smoothly as a gap in courtesy!<br />
Then you should smile!</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I have a happiness</span><br />
That makes it thievery in me to take<br />
Your pity. You've a sadder need.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">I'll yield</span><br />
No jocund vantage to that brow of yours.<br />
You hear this sombre braggart, Chartrien?<br />
Speaks as I were Despair's own fosterling!</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> You are. As I am Hope's. Do you not gaze<br />
On earth's foul spots and cry "A sad world this!"<br />
"We must endure!" "The dear God wills it so!"<br />
And such and such like seed of misery<br />
Till hopelessness sprouts chronic?&mdash;building then<br />
Your house of life amid its smelling weeds,<br />
Where you may dance&mdash;or pray&mdash;till you forget<br />
Your creed keeps earth in tears?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>  &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">And yours, my lord?</span></p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> Gives her a singing and forefeeling heart<br />
Whose courage cleaves renunciation's cloud<br />
That swathes her splendor and would sighing keep<br />
Her livid 'mong the stars!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You would divide</span><br />
Omnipotence with God, and arrogant,<br />
Assume the bigger half. But there are woes<br />
That even your hope, though it go winged and armored,<br />
Must fall before.</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>    &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not one that I'll not face</span><br />
Until its features mould me destiny.<br />
The shape of radiance it shall wear for man<br />
'Neath an unslandered Heaven! I could not live<br />
If in the life about me I saw not<br />
The world within this world, and sped my hope<br />
The way that it shall take.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Is not that way</span><br />
Called Peace, Emilio?</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>   &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Not the peace that spills</span><br />
More blood than war, builds bigger jails, and leaves<br />
More waifs to suck the stunting, poisonous breast<br />
Of Charity! Peace as white ashes spread<br />
Upon injustice' fly-blown wrack&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Leaving him</em>]  &nbsp;     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">You are</span><br />
A revolutionist!</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And black to you,</span><br />
For revolution leads into the horizon,<br />
And must be figured dark to rearward eyes<br />
Though God beyond gives welcome.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Coming gently back</em>]      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">May we not</span><br />
Be patient even as Christ, who found this world<br />
The home of poverty and left it so?<br />
Did he not say the poor are ever with us?</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> You too must tap that last and golden nail<br />
In th' pauper's coffin!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">It is the nail of truth,</span><br />
If Christ spoke true.</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Words uttered to his day,</span><br />
Not to all time. Not as a deathless brand<br />
Burning his own millennium. Not meant<br />
To take from man his goal, condemning him<br />
To hug an ulcer to the sick world's end,<br />
Which even your bosom must take to whitest bed<br />
Although your festrous partner be not guessed<br />
Nor visible. But if he did mean that&mdash;&mdash;<br />
That vicious thing&mdash;then he is false as hell,<br />
Denying man's bright destiny,&mdash;and I,<br />
Who vouch the triumph of an angel race,<br />
Am more a god than he!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You dare blaspheme&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>LeV.</em> Because it once was said to men, whom worms<br />
Made dust of twice ten hundred years ago,<br />
"The poor are always with you," such as you<br />
Shall not forever pick your way to ease<br />
O'er broken bodies, lifting up white brows<br />
And hiding crimson feet! Daring to make<br />
The Christ your sheltering sanction while you feed<br />
On others' lives, and keep injustice sleek<br />
Even as you cosset that dim thing, your soul,<br />
And preen the wings you think bear you aloft<br />
The puddled world!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">You lie! You do not know</span><br />
Our gentle hearts, our&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>LeV.</em>   &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Gentle? O, you're nice,</span><br />
You later cannibals, and will not eat<br />
Of babes at table, but you'll pipe their blood<br />
From unoffending distance, while you pray<br />
Your conscience numb and swear the source is clean.<br />
Some dare to name that fount the Love of God,<br />
And kneel him thanks!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, mad and impious!</span><br />
Who is this, Chartrien, you've dared call your friend?</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Megario steps from the grove</em>]</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> He's dumb as prudence, but my tongue is free.<br />

<p><em>Meg.</em> No third voice here is cordant. I will leave you.<br />
My thousand times most gracious lady, thanks!<br />
Again I bid you happiest good-night! [<em>Exit</em>]</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> I am no adder, though your bitter eyes<br />
Give me that name.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Not bitter. In my heart,</span><br />
That wrapped you as the South its dearest bud,<br />
There's nothing left to warm the thought of you<br />
Even with my hate. You are the crown, the peak,<br />
The unmeaning top of all to which I'm most<br />
Indifferent. [<em>Turns away</em>]</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Look at me!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I look, and know</span><br />
My eyes till now were cankered, look and see<br />
The whole fair lie you are.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Nay, Chartrien!</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> The book is open. There the brow yet shines<br />
As God o'erlilied it,&mdash;an altar urn<br />
Stuffed with profane decay. Those are the eyes<br />
Like springs within a wood where no road leads<br />
With murking pilgrim dust, yet Innocence<br />
There paused looks up no more. That is the hand<br />
That as a comrade angel's took my friend's,&mdash;<br />
Reached out as though it parted Heaven's veil<br />
To draw his grief within, then clapped him down<br />
To Hell.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> The place for traitors. Let him go.<br />
This moment is for us. 'Tis true your eyes<br />
Were cankered, and I thought by surgeon means<br />
To give them health, but deeper than the eyes<br />
This trouble's seat. Deep as your chang&egrave;d soul,<br />
That forfeits its divinity to link<br />
With an infection. Here you stood and heard<br />
Those poured-out profanations with no move<br />
Or sound of protest. That was left for me.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> What truth may pierce such ignorance, fatuous, thick!<br />
That man,&mdash;Megario,&mdash;with whom you've struck<br />
Alliant palm, twisted a lawless law<br />
To his deformed desire, and took the lands&mdash;<br />
The priceless valley lands of Cana Ru&mdash;<br />
From gentle dwellers there, whose titles bore<br />
The rooted claim of dear ancestral graves<br />
Nine generations deep,&mdash;and when they stood<br />
The guardians of their doors, faced them with guns,<br />
Dragged them to his bribed courts, weighed them with fines,<br />
And sent them to his burning maguey fields<br />
To slave and rot.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">No&mdash;don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">The lands were sold</span><br />
To Hudibrand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">It can not be!</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Not be?</span><br />
That cry is stale as ignorance, as old<br />
As wrong. I've heard it till my ears refuse<br />
To register its emptiness. LeVal,<br />
It was, rose first against Megario,&mdash;<br />
Stood up and urged men to be Man,&mdash;and this,<br />
That makes archangels in the ranks of Heaven,<br />
Was treason upon earth. He lived&mdash;escaped&mdash;<br />
But not his wife. Anointed woman, such<br />
As centuries with conjoined virtues breed<br />
Once and no more! She was condemned, enslaved,<br />
And toiling in the steaming fields, fell down,<br />
Was flogged, and died.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> No! no! no! no!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">So she</span><br />
Is free. But now LeVal goes back. My friend!<br />
O, giant heart! I see you stagger, drop,<br />
As feverous as the smitten earth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Who could</span><br />
Believe such things? You're wrong! You must&mdash;you shall<br />
Be wrong! He was a traitor, bitter-souled.<br />
Undoing my father's work!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Farewell!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Oh, Chartrien,</span><br />
I did it for the best!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">The woman's cry.</span><br />
She'd wreck a world, and from that earthquake piled<br />
Look up to say she did it for the best.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You will not go? You loved me one hour past.<br />
I am not changed. I'm Hernda still.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">The same.</span><br />
And yet I loved you. But no blush need burn<br />
The soul escaped enchantment. 'Twas a charm<br />
Enringed me with its bale till helpless there,<br />
And feeble as a babe in bassinet,<br />
I cooed away my manhood,&mdash;emptied time<br />
With infant fingering toward your protean hair!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You <em>loved</em> me!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">More than ever could be laid</span><br />
To madness' charge, or god that passion whelms<br />
With mortal longing till his skies become<br />
His prison, and dark earth Elysian ground<br />
Beneath the feet he loves!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>With arms beseeching</em>] Here, Chartrien, here!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> Even when my eyes&mdash;so late&mdash;were wide to wrong<br />
That binds the race to pain's dread Caucasus,<br />
My mad imagination laid the gift<br />
Of seership on you, dreamed that you would go<br />
To meet the gleam of the delivering days,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> With you!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sail any sea of venture, beat</span><br />
Through any storm to make the prophet's port,&mdash;<br />
White priestess vassal to the truth that leads<br />
The planet into light!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Together, Chartrien!</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> That was my dream. Then coming to your side.<br />
There was no life but yours,&mdash;no world that bled<br />
And felt the vulture feeding. Groans of men<br />
Grew still, or like the unavailing hum<br />
Of far-off, aimless bees, scarce reached my ears<br />
That heard, more near, as music from new earth,<br />
Your children call me father. Ay, 'twas but<br />
The storming undersea of passioning sex<br />
That breaking to the sky o'erlaid my stars<br />
And wore the mask of Heaven! That ebbless power,<br />
That spawning tide of Nature, by whose might<br />
She took primordial forts and made Life hers!<br />
Still does it tear belated, unassuaged,<br />
In wreck about the Mind's aspiring fanes.<br />
And shakes the nesting Spirit from her towers,<br />
Her heavenly brood unfledged!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Oh! Oh!</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Here&mdash;now&mdash;</span><br />
I beat it back, and go my way unmated<br />
Till beauty fair as yours has bred a soul<br />
And signals me! [<em>Exit</em>]</p>

<p class="negidt"><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <em>A grove in the outskirts of a town in Goldusan. Semi-tropical
verdure. Rocks, shrubbery, trees, at convenience. A hidden cascade
mumbles upper right, not loud enough to disturb conversation. At upper
left, the pillared and vine-wreathed entrance to a mansion. A wall,
rear, partly hidden by foliage. Paths lead off, right and left, lower,
under trees. It is evening, and the grove is lit for revel. Gay flocks
of people pass, then Hernda and Megario enter lower right.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Meg.</em> Unsoft as winter! Thou hast brought thy north,<br />
With thee, a frigid shade, here where the hours<br />
Are poppy-fingered, and their dreaming breasts<br />
Unshuttered as the summer!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Is it true,</span><br />
This joy, that smiles as though its fountained heart<br />
Could not be emptied?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">True as that I love you.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> But if it is no mask, why should revolt<br />
O'ercloud your borders?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">There's no just revolt.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> But Chartrien said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Are you yet poison-tinct</span><br />
With that old rebel tale his credulous heart<br />
Dressed new in his while honor till both grew<br />
One sooty treason?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Where is Chartrien now?</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Wherever he may hatch a discontent<br />
And cluck us trouble. But of late he spurs<br />
His heart of venture, and dartles to our towns<br />
To stir the scum there.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Scum? You've such a thing</span><br />
In Cordiaz' happy land? I'll see that scum.<br />
It breathes, does 't not? Has eyes, and tongue?<br />
Can answer if one speaks?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">You're merry, princess.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> As graves at night. All is not open here.<br />
I shall go farther,&mdash;knock at doors where Truth<br />
Keeps honest house, not gowned for holiday.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> One want we have,&mdash;that you will stay with us<br />
And be the fairy soul of Goldusan.<br />
Then must our land, so measureless endeared,<br />
Be cherished as the darling care of Heaven,<br />
Where storm may breathe but as a twittering bird<br />
That fears to shake its nest.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>    &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">You've only words!</span><br />
Words like these thousand-thousand smiles that seem<br />
Half real and half painted,&mdash;teasing, strange,&mdash;<br />
All feeding one illusion round my way<br />
Till even the ground unqualifies beneath me<br />
And makes each step a question.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">'Tis the doubt</span><br />
You look through that transforms our face<br />
Of truth and paints us vaguely hued.<br />
O, for our many smiles, wilt not give one?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Nay, there's a darkness fringing on this grove.<br />
It creeps above the walls, it touches me,<br />
And makes me shudder winding at my feet!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> You've sipped of fancy at a witch's knee! [<em>Plucks a flower</em>]<br />

But see,&mdash;your serpent shadows nurture this.<br />
Confess to its perfection, and be shriven<br />
Of any thought less fair.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, if I might!</span><br />
No, keep it. Let us find our friends.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> [<em>Drops the flower</em>]      <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">My hand</span><br />

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">'Tis burnt!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> What wind's your gossip?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Truth paused at my ear.</span><br />
But, princess, if there's any charm will draw<br />
Your eyes to me unburdened of their hate,<br />
I'll find it though it lie beneath the ruin<br />
Of every other hope!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I'll leave you, sir.</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Forgive me! Love will speak,&mdash;ay, storm its need.<br />

<p><em>Her.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">My lord, no hate</span><br />
Is in that barrier. I'm free of that.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Thanks for that little much. Your highness speaks<br />
Of journeying. What can I say to gild<br />
My own Peonia till it distant gleams<br />
The gem of pilgrimage? There you will see<br />
How earth is dressed when the devoted sun<br />
Is pledged to her adorning. Trees that mass<br />
Their bloom in forest heavens, giving her<br />
A nearer sky. Unthwarted vines that scarf<br />
Her mountain shoulders with their pendent clouds.<br />
Lakes where a dreamer's bark may drift unoared<br />
And chance no port save beauty. Everywhere<br />
The dart and wave of color that would beckon<br />
A neighbor planet looking once this way.<br />
Come, be my guest. One day! I'll ask no more.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> I do not know. Se&ntilde;ora Ziralay<br />
Will be my guide. I go with her.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">With her?</span></p>

Against a king yet rich in arms and friends.<br />
And Hudibrand is not so absolute<br />

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">O, heavenly retraction!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> And if I ask a service it will be<br />
No paltry one, but such as makes the king<br />
Bow to the knight.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I'll prove this grace</span><br />
Is native in me, and not solely lent<br />
Of your new bounty!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Would you save the life</span><br />
Of Chartrien?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> I would. Though a treasonous tool<br />

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">A prisoner!</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> You can not ask his freedom! That would give<br />

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">You'd dare that?</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> My policy is open, and I'd dare<br />
To put it into deed that must commend me<br />
To their unwilling justice. To do more<br />
Would disarray all sense,&mdash;be fullest like<br />

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">But yes.</span><br />
I push me by its fragile guardians,<br />
And hear it beating in its citadel.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> What says it then?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">You've seen the prince.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 16em;">My lord!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">No, no, no!</span><br />
My oath, sir, I've not seen him!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">I would trust</span><br />
One negative, not three. Give him to me,<br />
And you will know he lives. Let him be found<br />
By Vardas' men, and when you wake to-morrow<br />
The earth will be without him.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">No, not you!</span><br />
I'll go to Cordiaz. He'll save the prince<br />
As he would save his throne. You've taught me that.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> He'd lose it so. Should Cordiaz to-night<br />
Set Chartrien free, he'd rise without a lord<br />
To bid him one good-morrow.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Ziralay....</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ask him? An ass whose ears if visible</span><br />
Would signal Mars! Say he had courage for you,<br />
He'd blunder with the prince to Vardas' arms.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Ah, <em>you</em> could do it,&mdash;set him free!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Nay&mdash;don't&mdash;</span><br />
Don't ask it, if you've mercy! Your highness knows<br />
I could not grant so much though lips I love<br />

And he no longer lives.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">He does! My oath,</span><br />
He does!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You spared him?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">By my soul, he lives!</span><br />
But let the word sleep in your vestal ear,<br />
Until these smouldering troubles die to dust<br />
And feed the grass above them. For the State<br />
Believes LeVal is dead, nor taints me with<br />
Such treacherous clemency. See how I lay<br />
My safety and my honor in your hands?<br />
I give them, hostages for Chartrien!<br />
Ah, you should know how I will guard your trust,<br />
For when I say to you he does not live,<br />
Your eyes will slay the single, nurturing hope<br />
Of my own life!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> [<em>Battling</em>] I can not! I'm not Fate<br />
To do her awesome work.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">We aid her most</span><br />
With passive hand, as Chartrien's ghost will come<br />
On mourning nights to tell you.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Oh, I'll speak!...</span><br />
No, no! Ah, never, never!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> [<em>Resolute, giving up his suit</em>] I must join<br />
The hunt. There's but one place&mdash;the cave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 15em;">The cave!</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> Those guards are fools&mdash;or shy of water.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 16em;">Sir,</span><br />
What cave?</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> He's there. Your cold, uncandid calm<br />
Has babbled it. The frost is crafty that<br />
Puts out such anxious fire.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">My lord, if I</span><br />
Should tell you....</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Quickly then! How canst debate</span><br />
So fatally, knowing delay but robs him<br />
Of venture's favor? Every moment steals<br />
A bud of chance.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">How will you take him out?</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> I'll pass the gates unchallenged. Close without,<br />
My car stands by,&mdash;a racer never spent,<br />
And begs no pause. Know he is safe, and sleep.<br />
Night will be secret, and we'll greet the sun<br />
In my Peonia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ah, Peonia's far!</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> And Vardas near.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Take these two stones, my lord.</span><br />
Cast them into the falls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">So! I was right!</span><br />
But you must summon him.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">So soon a tyrant?</span></p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> I'll take him from your hands,&mdash;no other way.<br />
Your trust to me! And with my life I'll guard it!<br />
For that you love him is my means to you.<br />
Once in your heart, I'll win the throned place<br />
Though all his saints defend it!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">True, my friend,</span><br />
We shall be nearer, for anxiety<br />
Will draw me to you with a longing like<br />
The aching letch for morning in the eyes<br />
Pain keeps astare. You then will be the goal<br />
Of fondest question,&mdash;and from that&mdash;who knows?<br />
Out of unbroken faith, and kindly shafts<br />
'Tween hearts disponent, bridges have been built<br />
For love's plenipotence to cross.</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">You bid</span><br />
Me hope?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> I do not say despair. Sometimes<br />
A presto-worker sits within the soul<br />
Of gratitude, and love that must give thanks<br />
In name of one beloved, has then been known<br />
To pass from the liege object to the heart<br />
Whose compass held them both in selfless bounds<br />
Of chivalry. And yet&mdash;I promise nothing!</p>

<p><em>Meg.</em> I ask no promise but the one I find<br />
In words that so deny it. Now the thought<br />
Is born, I'll make the naked infant grow<br />
Heir of my princely opportunity.<br />
Go now. An instant may defeat us. Haste!<br />

In midmost desert sands, and suddenly<br />
A flower at your feet breathed of the woods<br />
And darkling velvet shade where rest might be....</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> But that's a miracle.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">So was her love</span><br />
To me. Or say that flam and falsity<br />
Ensnarled your every way till no true thing<br />
Seemed left on earth, and then in lifted flash<br />
Truth's priestess eyes looked from a human face<br />
And you were loved,&mdash;what startled warmth would say<br />
Your heart yet lived? Would you keep back your life<br />
In barren hug? Deny its sunless gray<br />
To gentle eyes that asked but leave to lay<br />
Their radiance there?</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> I understand. She gave,<br />
And I demanded. So the gods decree<br />
Her boughs shall bloom and mine go bare.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Oh, Heaven!</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> You love her, Chartrien?</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Silence be on that.</span></p>

<p><em>Her.</em> I'll know it,&mdash;hear you say it. Is your heart<br />
Mine, or Famette's?</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> My life is hers.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your heart!</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> Is yours.</p>

<p><em>Her.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ah! Then&mdash;I give you to Famette.</span></p>

<p><em>Hud.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Is that for me, my boy?</span></p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> As many lives tramped out in hunger's scramble,<br />
As many factories where driven wives<br />

Whose only fortune is to ache no more.<br />
As many brazen mills that noise their thrift<br />

While you, the great arch-master, think none hears<br />

Due to its substance, not to my good pattern.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> That stuff, sir, is the same that lifted us<br />
From four feet up to two! The elements<br />
That played like death upon it but aroused<br />
Their conqueror. In the embrace of winds<br />
It made us ships and gave us wings. From dust,<br />
The very dust that choked it, grew the dream<br />

The civic split&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em> You dream! This is not true!</p>

<p><em>Her.</em> Yes, Chartrien, it is true. We've lost Bolderez.</p>

Bears on its tide the conquering desire<br />

Invisible veterans?</p>

Can never light,&mdash;some dream till we have oped<br />

Of Goldusan, there's courage on the leap<br />
To reach his side.</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Come, come!</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">I mean the words. The race has learned</span><br />
Its lesson while you've played with sand. At last<br />
The dumb, trod way has spoken 'neath man's feet,<br />
And by that word uncovered he has learned<br />
What he shall <em>not</em> be,&mdash;knows what heights of sun<br />
Are his, and seeing takes his road,&mdash;no more<br />
Battering in wild and bruis&egrave;d ignorance<br />
A destiny of stone. Ay, consciousness<br />
Has wakened in itself the unknown god<br />
That gives the race its eyes. You, you a king?<br />
Who do not know that every man is heir<br />
To kingship that must leave such thrones as yours<br />
Outcoursed and little recked as the strewn toys<br />
Of childhood!</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> Mud-sill dynasties. You know<br />
That I am master.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Master? You believe</span><br />
That man, at top of conquest, who has made<br />
Nature his weariless serf, and set the yoke<br />
From his own neck on her divinities,<br />
Will seal to you&mdash;weak, myriadth part of him&mdash;<br />
Those wizard captives bending to the dream<br />
Of his new world? Gird you with fortune that<br />
He wrenched from stony ages?&mdash;let you gorge<br />
The magic fruit snatched by his perilled being<br />
In starward battle up the abysmal steep?</p>

<p><em>Hud.</em> I am a fact,&mdash;not words.</p>

<p><em>Cha.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">You can believe it?</span><br />
At last on dawn-browed heights, with victor foot<br />
On mysteries bound the genii of his wish,<br />
He'll trail his hopes to kennel? Let you pluck<br />
His universe unflowered, and shrink life<br />
To growling brevity 'tween lash and bone?<br />
A slave to <em>you</em>? Obstructive clod,<br />

Should score her script upon you!</p>

<p class="negidt"><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <em>Pelagon's garden, Athens. Wall, rear, shutting off street. Upper
right, path to street gate. Upper and middle left, entrances to
Pelagon's house. Lower left, path to a neighbor's dwelling. Lower right,
path leading deeper into garden.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Enter, upper left, Pelagon, Stesilaus and Lysander</em>]</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> A gracious senate! If such welcome keys<br />
The tune to come, then our ambassadry<br />
Is concord's instrument, and we may bear<br />
Fair music back to Sparta.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>        <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Tut, the smiles</span><br />
Of Athens are as flying leaves, divorced<br />
From the tree's heart, as apt to light<br />
On vagrancy as merit.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Stesilaus</span><br />
Bears hard as truth. Yet I was warmed to note<br />
The council's greeting.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ever Sparta's friend!</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> And friend of peace. The age no more can bear<br />
The locked alarum of our rivalling States.<br />
We must the groaning tussle bring to end,<br />
Or ends the world.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">'Twas wisdom's cue you gave us,&mdash;</span><br />
To say we had our Sparta's sovereign word<br />
For Athens' terms.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>    &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ay, hold your embassage</span><br />
Unstrictured, friends. In that lies flattery<br />
Each lord will take to himself and thereon feed<br />
A grace which will, in sort, come back to you.<br />
What hour was fixed for answer? I lost that.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> The last hour of the sun.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">The crier stood</span><br />
Wrong side of my good ear, and I'll not twist<br />
To set the gossips nudging me to th' grave,<br />
Robbed in a shrug of twenty grizzled years. [<em>Looks about the garden</em>]<br />
Where's Biades? He's always trailing here,<br />
Save in the tick of need. I'd have him bid<br />
The ambassadors lie at my house. Lysander,<br />
You'll be my suitor to your comrades? Say<br />
We've heart and room for all.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">For all, my lord?</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> And more!</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Exit Lysander</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">My Sparta thanks you, Pelagon.</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> Nay, such an honor shall not pass me, sir.<br />
Now where is Biades?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your nephew, friend?</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> Ay, Stesilaus. Bar my blood in him,<br />
He'll fasten on your heart.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Report has been</span><br />
Too dear his friend. What buzz about a youth<br />
Of twenty-five! Sir, Attica is mad<br />
To give him captainship. In Sparta now,<br />
The spurring callant would be kept in ranks,<br />
And yoked with Prudence till he learned her jog.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> In ranks! I see him! Well, just in your ear,<br />
He sweeps a pretty curvet. With my wife<br />
His slave, and Phania neck-deep in love,<br />
He rides the very comb of my poor house.<br />
If you would say to him, hold here or there,<br />
I'd take it not amiss. But I do love him.<br />
And now a bout with th' cook. The pest sends word<br />
A double score of sudden guests are all<br />
He'll have at table. Mine own table, sir!<br />
Ha, there is Biades! He'll wait upon you.<br />
Pray touch him as I've hinted. But no word<br />
About our daughters, friend. We'll let that lie.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Exit upper left. Enter Biades upper right</em>]</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Most noble Stesilaus, my heart greets you!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Greeting to Biades, whom Athens makes<br />
Her general!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Would, my lord, this dignity<br />
Were laid on senior years. Your Sparta's way<br />
Is best,&mdash;to keep the cool, meridian bays<br />
From youth-flushed brows. My moist and charm&egrave;d eyes<br />
Spoke inward to my soul when they beheld<br />
The ambassadors before the council, each<br />
With staff unneeded, and gray locks that seemed<br />
As wisdom's holy place.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>    &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You sat with us?</span><br />
I did not mark you there.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I kept in modest shadow,</span><br />
Which is youth's fairest mantle,&mdash;though my rank<br />
Moves back for none. But, sir, the Spartan elders!<br />
Ah, might I see more men in Athens who<br />
Thus honor age, and age that honors men!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Breathe that into your shrines.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 11em;">The gods who smile</span><br />
On folly young, must weep when reverend years<br />
And wisdom part. Mayhap you've noticed, sir,<br />
In my good uncle here ... a falling off.<br />
I would not speak but that I know your eyes<br />
Can not keep curtain when the blabbing sun<br />
Makes it no secret.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Somewhat I have seen.</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Somewhat will grow to much ere you take leave.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> I fear it, Biades.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">And yet, my lord,</span><br />
Time has not carried him ahead of you<br />
More years than half a score.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Tis t'other way.</span><br />
I'm elder by that much.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Not you, my lord?</span><br />

     <span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<em>Muses flatteringly</em>]</span><br />

The Spartan way is best. Was 't Pelagon<br />
Led you to say you had full power to treat<br />
With Athens?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> It was he.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I thought it. [<em>Sighs</em>] Sir,</span><br />
In the Athenian mind there dwells a child<br />
No length of days can age. We do not grow<br />
As Spartans. But our vanity's no dwarf.<br />
Tops with the highest, you've some cause to know.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> What of 't? Unlatch! unlatch!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 11em;">The people, sir,</span><br />
Always our rearward urge, knowing you've power<br />
To assent to all they ask, will ask for more<br />
Than all.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Think'st that?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">In your brave time you've met</span><br />
Athenians of the best. Didst ever know<br />
One modest?&mdash;slow to ask for what he thought<br />
His own?&mdash;or what he might by mere demand<br />
Make his?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> They are well stomached,&mdash;true. No doubt<br />
They'll press us far.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">They will. And if refused,&mdash;</span><br />
Well, they are children,&mdash;and must bite and scratch.<br />
With strutting rage, may pelt you out of Athens.<br />
But why not say you are in part empowered.<br />
And must return to Sparta with the terms<br />
Before a vowed conclusion?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Late for that,</span><br />
Young sir. The tongue we used to the Council<br />
Must serve in the Assembly. We have said<br />
We have full power.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">To treat, not to assent.</span><br />
That was your word.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hmm! Now the cloud is off</span><br />
The dunce's script, and I read clear why you<br />
At twenty-five have Athens' voice to sail<br />
'Gainst Syracuse.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Re-enter Pelagon</em>]</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> No word unto my uncle!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> My brain will serve.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">They've come,&mdash;your comrades,&mdash;all!</span><br />
If honor now were substance, my poor walls<br />
Would groaningly unroof and beg the sky<br />
For room to embrace it! Go you, Biades.<br />
Repeat my welcome, with increase of grace<br />
Your tongue is rich in.<br />

     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<em>Exit Biades, upper left</em>]</span><br />

     <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Now the full time comes.</span><br />
We'll speak of that that's centre of our hearts,&mdash;<br />
Our daughters, friend. This is the hour that ends<br />
A watch of twenty years.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">A patient score.</span><br />
So long your daughter has been mine, so long<br />
Has mine been yours.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Like flower upon a stalk</span><br />
Long nursed and tended, comes the end upon<br />
This day of budding peace. You've had no whiff,<br />
No hint untoward, that what we did had best<br />
Been left undone?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sir, what I do, I do!</span><br />
When we changed babes not past their cradle sleep,<br />
My mind then glossed the act with comment fair<br />
As our unfructured hope. So does it still.<br />
By Nestor, though I'm thitherward of prime,<br />
There's none will say that with accreted years<br />
I moult sagacity!</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Eh, so! 'Twas well.</span><br />
I've never doubted it. Here have I reared<br />
Your Phania, Spartan-thewed, who now shall home<br />
With Athens' gentle nurture in her veins<br />
To hither yearn in blood of every son<br />
She bears to Sparta. And you my Pyrrha bring<br />
Back to her land to live a Spartan dame<br />
Among Athenian mothers. So we feed<br />
The unity we dream on,&mdash;quicken time,<br />
Foresued, to give our tousing, touchy States<br />
One civic heart.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Has Sachinessa kept</span><br />
A secret tongue?</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">A nut not closer sits</span><br />
About its kernel. And your wife, my friend?<br />
What of Archippe? Did she hold for long<br />
Against the exchange?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">She did. Nor ever learned</span><br />
To love your Pyrrha. For that cause,&mdash;and that<br />
Our even trust might move with even faith,<br />
Nor odds of grace to you,&mdash;I've stood her guard,<br />
And made her comrade where a son might claim<br />
The dearest post.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Good thanks, my Stesilaus.</span><br />
From your wife's audit I'd not brush a doit,<br />
But to the credit of my dame can set<br />
A fairer sum. &AElig;neas' curl&egrave;d lad<br />
Lay not more dearly in his Dido's lap<br />
Than your sweet Phania in the swaddling love<br />
Of Sachinessa. Ay, she'll swear me now<br />
That not to gain her own will she give up<br />
Her foster darling.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Humph!</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">The little duck!</span><br />
She has so chucked herself into my heart<br />
'Twill put me sad about to oust her.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Duck!</span><br />
When I lose Pyrrha, sir, that hour I lose<br />
This good right arm!</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> [<em>Meditative</em>] Hmm! So!... Come, my friend.<br />
The dinner's toward, and the host astray.<br />
The love's deep-vouched that puts such duty off<br />
For one more word. [<em>Pauses as they move left</em>]<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">We'll give no open voice</span><br />
To our most dear concern till we have met<br />
Our daughters.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> [<em>Gloomy</em>] Met our daughters! Have it so.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Exeunt upper left. Enter, middle left, Phania and Biades</em>]</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Come, Phania! The old cocks are off.</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 14em;">They're gone?</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Good flitting too! I feared they'd perch till night,<br />
Crowing the deeds of Stesilaus the Great<br />
And Pelagon the Wise.</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">These Spartans! If</span><br />
They'd rest their clubs without the door, our shins<br />
Would give them thanks. Why are we so besieged?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Why, Phania, why? Because your father dotes<br />
On dull and sodden peace that never was<br />
Save in an old man's dream. We dine our foes!<br />
The city must throw ope her gates, forsooth,<br />
Lest the dear enemy should take some hurt<br />
Scaling the walls! They'd bleed us as we sleep,<br />
And Pelagon would vow the sword at 's throat<br />
Were Sachinessa's dozing kiss.</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Ho, hear</span><br />
The captain speak! You go to Syracuse,<br />
And not content? 'Tis well there's one cries peace.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> What's Syracuse? To conquer Sparta,&mdash;that<br />
Were warrior's work! Your father robs me of it,<br />
Bringing the water where I set my fires.<br />
But come! I've not made love to a soul to-day<br />
Save ancient Sparta. Ha! it is an art<br />
That should be spared such sweat. The Heavens mean<br />
That I shall pull to yoke these two days left,<br />
And love take beggar's chance.</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Ah, but two days!</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Come to our myrtle nook&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Nay, Sybaris</span><br />
Might turn me out. That is her royal seat<br />
When you'll play consort.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">What, my Phania? Dour?</span><br />
Does Creon keep away?</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">I'm not for him.</span><br />
You know it, Biades.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">But he does not.</span><br />
Too oft I find him here.</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">And Sybaris</span><br />
Comes out of count, knowing you like this spot.<br />
Yon path is worn of every blade.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Her feet</span><br />
Can be so cruel?</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">You love her still!</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Nay, sweet.</span><br />
Not for three days. Believe me, cousin!</p>

<p><em>Pha.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 12em;"><em>Cousin!</em></span><br />
Athene save us! See her now,&mdash;the plague!</p>

You make contentment creep on honored bones<br />

<p><em>Sac.</em> This, Pelagon. When in that sad year gone<br />
You took my child from me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">What? That again?</span></p>

<p><em>Sac.</em> Not that, but this. I did not stay you then,<br />
Being young in wedlock and my wit at cheep<br />
In its first feathers. But this second time<br />
When you lift up your hand to cut the bough<br />
Whose root is in my heart, I'll speak so loud<br />
That if your dull ear miss, I'll reach you yet<br />
By way o' the stars that will cry back my wrong<br />
When they so hear it.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">You would beg for Phania?</span></p>

<p><em>Sac.</em> I would. There is no source of love so great<br />
As brooding care. That makes the mother, not<br />
The childing pangs. Though she, from the first hour,<br />
Will cherish what she must so dearly buy,<br />
'Tis day by watchful day her swelling love<br />
Is born. So I, as new days past, forgot<br />
The child of my brief pain, and gave to one<br />
That nestled in her place my care-born love.<br />
Now you would strike again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Sweet, by my soul,&mdash;</span><br />
Nay, Sachinessa, dearest heart, be calm.<br />
Your words have never in our mated life<br />
Moved me as now. If Stesilaus yields,<br />
And his stern will be broken by your plea,<br />
I am content.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> I'm so far moved, my friend,<br />
That I will hear Archippe speak her wish.<br />
Her love for Pyrrha will not match with that<br />
Your wife bestows on Phania.</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Ay, my lord,</span><br />
I've never loved the stranger as my own,<br />
But she is dearer than my own grown strange.<br />
I see in Phania all my tender loss,<br />
But it is lost forever. Give me, Pyrrha.<br />
I have no other daughter.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Keep her, dame.</span><br />
But make this weakness not your heckling ground<br />
Where you would spar for favors. No more suits!</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> And, Sachinessa, hear the same from me.</p>

<p><em>Sac.</em> You borrow feathers and I'll twitch 'em out!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> [<em>To Archippe</em>] Lest you should badger, footed safe on this,<br />
Know that my judgment's not earwigged by you<br />
To this repeal, but now configures pat<br />
To the act itself, that keeps a constant step<br />
With our first purpose. Our intent comes out<br />
With even edges, though reversed in face.<br />
An Athens' maid shall be a Spartan mother,<br />
And here shall dwell a dame of Spartan blood.</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> You hear it, Sachinessa. I'm not one<br />
To throw my pack away in sight of home.<br />
Come mud, come mire, I bear my judgment out,<br />
As Athens knows.</p>

<p><em>Sac.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I'll swear to it there's no man</span><br />
I' the city better hides the sun with a sieve!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> And secondly, my dame, know that I've won<br />
My high contention that the laws of Sparta<br />
Are best for brooding earth a godlike race.<br />
For here my proof enroots in warmest life<br />
That they can aggrandize the chalky veins<br />
Of pampered Attica to ducts that bear<br />
The red, unconquered sap of Laced&aelig;mon.</p>

<p><em>Sac.</em> So Pyrrha is your proof!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">No question there.</span><br />
A weak, Athenian babe grows up the pride<br />
Of Sparta, while a budling of her own,<br />
Nursled by Athens' soft and careless shift,<br />
Scarce grows to woman's level&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Sac.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Why, you puffed&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
You pride-blown&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Come with me!</span></p>

<p><em>Sac.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 12em;">But such a bladder!</span><br />
He'd top a flood into the second world<br />
And wet but half his skin!</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Nay, Sachinessa,</span><br />
Our suit is won. No words! We'll haste once more<br />
To Philon's shrine. For this dear joy I'll bend<br />
A willing knee. Come, come!<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<em>Draws her away, upper right</em>]</span></p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> [<em>Capering</em>] Could reel it now<br />

<p><em>Dia.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You, Nacia, are not so lithe</span><br />

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">The bare and brazen sun</span><br />
That's up without a cloud, cheers to the hunt,<br />
The fight, the bruited path,&mdash;makes careful dames<br />

We'll air the beds!"</p>

<p><em>Nac.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ay, wives must know their season.</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> But let night-swimming Morn come up<br />
In foamy veil, and her priest-hearted rose<br />

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why, Artante, when we dance</span><br />
Half naked as we do before the youths,<br />
They say of us "A bed-mate there, and strong<br />
To bear and breed brave warriors for my house."<br />
But they in Athens who so watch the dance,<br />
See sheatheless Being shine through form that would,<br />

And leave unseen the token of a grace<br />
Earth may not shadow.</p>

It is the agent of divinest mould<br />
In all the world. By it the mind grows fair<br />

And who is here that could with putting on<br />

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> We grant you, none.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your hearts then struck my blow,</span><br />
Therefore must pardon it. If Agis' death<br />
Falls from it, 'tis but accident that sleeps<br />
In every motion, and in mine awoke<br />
Untimely. Who, so shorn of wisdom, thinks<br />
That I, a suitor here for barest life,<br />
Meant him a vital stroke that would o'ercry<br />
My prayers and make a mock of suppliance?<br />

<p><em>Ste.</em> So you resolve, but Hecate at his smile<br />

<p><em>Ste.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Prove this?</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Why made you Stesilaus head and tongue<br />
Of envoy unto Athens? For you thought<br />
His mind, most apt, fluidic, politic,<br />
More quick than danger, would take shape of need,<br />
Repairing your defense fast as you found<br />
Your safety cramped. If I o'ercame him then<br />
With wit that watched with sleepless spear at door<br />

To be of Sparta's armor.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Our dead shall answer!</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> They shall. For every heart my steel made cold,<br />
Is proof how well I served my Athens,&mdash;proof<br />
Of loyal heat with which I'll serve the State<br />
That makes me hers! A true-bred Greek, outthrust<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 18em;">[<em>They take hands</em>]</span></p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> So soft?</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Better than blows.</span></p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Ha! Like disease</span><br />
He'll spread the woman till our eyes drop tears<br />
Instead of fire. When Spartan eagles moult,<br />
They'll go no farther than Athenian owls.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> He's valiant.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">There's no braver tongue.</span></p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> <span style="margin-left: 14em;">And friend</span><br />

<p><em>Ste.</em> So he says.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Nay, that's well known.</span></p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> My captain comrades, and ye aged fathers,<br />
If ye had seen him strut, a vanity<br />
As brainless as the monkey at his heels,<br />
With woman velvets making slut of wealth<br />
Trailing foul dust,&mdash;a peacock fan at 's cheek<br />
Where a soldier's beard should grow, and bangled ears<br />
Whose swinging jewels tickled a white neck<br />
Soft as a harlot's pillow,&mdash;this at time<br />
His city laid such honor on his head<br />
As would have kept a brave man on his knees<br />
For wisdom to uphold it,&mdash;had ye looked on this,<br />
Ye'd call the weakest maiden from her wheel<br />
To lead our wars ere trust to Biades!</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> A picture this,&mdash;shakes faith.</p>

<p><em>Second Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10em;">We trust too far.</span></p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Sirs, had ye seen what I but paint&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 14em;">My lords,</span><br />
I'll wrestle with the stoutest Spartan youth<br />
That makes your wars most dreaded, and these limbs,<br />
Now shrunk with fasting, wasted and forsook<br />
By Fortune that once fed them as her own,<br />
Will prove my right to captain Sparta's host!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Our women could undo you, girl of Athens!<br />
Meet his bold brag with this. One of our maids<br />
Shall throw him! Ay! Then he'll betake his shame<br />
To any shade will hide it.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Sir, I sue</span><br />
To lay this boast.</p>

<p><em>Agis.</em> <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">My prayer be first, my lords!</span></p>

<p><em>Voices.</em> A lot! A lot!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Nay, sons, a fall from you</span><br />
Would give him hope to pick his honor up<br />
And steal again to favor. He will plead<br />
That you, full-fed, met him in famished hour,<br />
When Fate hung him with bruises leeching strength,<br />
And gave you victory. Let my offer hold.<br />
A maiden to him, and we'll hear no more<br />
Of valorous Biades.</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> We are agreed.</p>

<p><em>Second Ephor.</em> Who is our strongest maid?</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> <span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">We've six whose claims</span><br />

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We'll choose from these.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Olympus, shower me woes! I will not cringe,<br />
So they be man's. But save me from a mock<br />
That makes misfortune past seem sweet as drops<br />
From Hera's healing cup!</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">A mock? The gods</span><br />
Have never honored you till now.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">See these,</span><br />
My bantling? Arms that made Kalides wear<br />
A three months' bruise!</p>

<p><em>The.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">And these have locked the strength</span><br />
Of Lenon in defeat!</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Ask Mirador</span><br />
If he liked well the sandy bed I gave him.</p>

<p><em>Nac.</em> Bethink you now how you'll outcrow disgrace,<br />
For you'll be short of breath when you've gone through<br />
The brash I'll give you.</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Then he'll show his reefed</span><br />
And wattled skin, and say that want of bread<br />
O'ercame him, not our valor.</p>

<p><em>Art.</em> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Look you, maids!</span><br />
His hollow eyes do beg some pity of us.<br />
We'll give him yet a chance, and mate him with<br />
Our lame Coraina. She's near well again.<br />
Will drop her crutch to be our champion.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Zeus,</span><br />
Behold me patient! Furies, though I lack<br />
Some vaunting flesh, the sharpest ill that on<br />
My body ravins feeds a spirit that<br />
Might meet with Heracles and give him need<br />
Of both his arms!</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> Ha! Better! Maids, his tongue<br />
Will fight yet!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Peace! The ephors choose</span><br />
That Dianessa bear this honor off.<br />
She threw strong Mirador, first of the youths,<br />
Which puts her o'er the rest.</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">We've else determined</span><br />
That with the fall the Athenian forfeits life.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> And if I win, my lords? Since life must pay<br />
Defeat, should victory not solicit me<br />
With counterpois&egrave;d prize?</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">We shall accept you</span><br />

Shall be your bride, and bind you son and brother<br />
To Sparta's love.</p>

<p><em>Second Ephor.</em> You, Stesilaus, assent?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Since without risk you may pursue your folly,<br />
I'll not oppose you.</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dianessa, you</span><br />
Abide our will?</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> And welcome it. 'Twill work<br />
Like Mars in me, and make my arm<br />
The gallows of his fame. The Athenian lady!<br />
I'd choose a husband among men.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10em;">And I,</span><br />
My generous, dear lords, would woo and win<br />
Some mute and humble maid. I would not force<br />
The noble Dianessa bend her head<br />
To one unworthied by a hostile Fate.</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> Tut, sir! If Fortune's love returns with heat<br />
That makes you conqueror, by that same sun<br />
Her pride will melt, and you will find her meek<br />
As gosling in your hand.</p>

<p><em>Second Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis settled so.</span><br />
Wear what you win.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Rising</em>] Ye reverend men, and you,<br />
My noble father, may my suit reveal<br />
My love to Sparta and your love to me,<br />
Which has not spoken in this act of yours<br />
That overpeers me and gives up my due<br />
To Dianessa.</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> Ha?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Though Mirador</span><br />
Was forced below her, never in a bout<br />
Has she ta'en honors from me, while I oft<br />
Have left her down.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Hear herself</span><br />
Avouch it.</p>

<p><em>Dia.</em> Ay, you overmate me, but<br />
The gap between us will not cast the match<br />
To Biades. And I was chosen.</p>

<p><em>Fourth Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Nay,</span><br />
You must give place.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I've other reason, sir.</span><br />
It is my dear, war-honored father lays<br />
This match on Sparta, and my pride of house<br />

The sage's seal upon it.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Bare duty might so speak.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 9em;">&nbsp;This gives me warmth</span><br />
My maiden comrades lack. By every vein<br />
My father gave me, his time-laurelled brow<br />
Shall never wear a garland less!</p>

<p><em>Second Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Well sworn!</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> And for I saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Third Ephor.</em> More reasons?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 9em;">&mdash;the rude shame</span><br />
The Athenian put upon the ambassadors,<br />
And mine own eyes bore him in lowest semblance,<br />
Demeaned from manhood, his dishonor wrapped<br />
In purple cost that left it yet more naked.<br />
I swear he shall not honored lead our wars!<br />
If our gray heroes fail us, we have dames<br />
To choose from,&mdash;need not go to Athens!</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> This speaks! The victory's won where courage makes<br />
Such stout provision.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 5em;">If I fail, my lords,</span><br />
Then gods are mongers and their favors sell,<br />
Denying honest prayers.</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Come, Biades.</span><br />
Art ready?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Ay, long past!</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your places then.</span></p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Delay you! Biades, with modesty<br />
Unlooked for, but most fit, you gave up claim<br />
To Dianessa.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Nay, 'twas but an offer<br />
Whose bounty met refusal.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">I'll accept it</span><br />
In Pyrrha's name.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">So prudent against loss?</span><br />
This caution, sir, gives me a victor's heart.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Triumph is hers a certain thousand times,<br />
And yours a dicer's once, slipped you between<br />
Hiccough and snore of gods at shutting time.<br />
But since that once will have a thousandth chance<br />
To trouble me, I'll grant you free of Pyrrha.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Wait till 'tis begged. Lysander spoke with kind<br />
And equal honor, which did soften me<br />
To leave his daughter his. And others here<br />
Have tendered me the gentle looks that breed<br />
The answering benison till hearts of earth<br />
Feel heaven's element. But you, whose hate<br />
Should hiss from crawling shape, not upright man's,<br />
Wake fires in me that eat through godly patience<br />
And sweep to battle. I'll endure no further.<br />
Back with your taunts! And if 'twill make you sore<br />
Where pride is daintiest, I'll your daughter wed<br />
Because she is your daughter!</p>

As snaked Medusa,&mdash;her brow a hanging night,&mdash;<br />
Her figure hooped as age when chin and toes<br />
Are neighbors,&mdash;and of speech so scaly, harsh<br />
As Stesilaus,&mdash;I, with no more color<br />
Or shade of reason than that you deny me,<br />
Would make her bride. The ephors gave their word,<br />
And what I win I'll wear!</p>

<p><em>First Ephor.</em> <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">We'll see you do.</span><br />
Content you, Stesilaus. None will weep<br />

<p><em>Hie.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Move again? The ship</span><br />

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">She is.</span><br />
And shall go farther. Here's no fighting deck.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> Ay, these soft cabins, Corinth-modelled as<br />
A prince, would make a floating holiday,<br />
Put soldiers from their place.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">The ship must lie</span><br />
Full east, on th' safest wave. We've treasure 'neath<br />

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">No,&mdash;a woman. Come,</span><br />

<p><em>Lys.</em> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Sir, what time wilt take your place<br />
Aboard the <em>Ino</em>?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Give me till the midnight,</span><br />
I'll from that moment be your admiral.<br />
But for these gentle hours that lie between,<br />

<p class="center">[<em>Exeunt Lysander, Biades, and Hieron</em>]</p>

Till palling breath became the shroud of action,<br />
And yet refused it funeral.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I know</span><br />
How you have doubted. O, this soul of Sparta,<br />
That can not trust! It peeps from every eye,<br />
Deepest where kindest. Tags each friendly word<br />
With its unspoken dread,&mdash;and comradeship,<br />
That strives to wrap it in a gala cloak,<br />
Strains vainly round the huge, dun doubt, agape<br />
In dreary revelation.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">You are free</span><br />
To leave us.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Free? Five Spartan nobles watch<br />
Beside me, move with every step, for so<br />

Foregoes his place at sacrifice to serve<br />
My dignity. Not for his gods he'll put<br />
A furlong 'tween us.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">He's the ship's good eye.</span><br />
And all the men except the lords of guard<br />

But I would woo you with no ear at the door.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Rising</em>] My lord!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Indifferent</em>] Nay, then. I can't oppose the sex<br />
Of Aphrodite. My one frailty.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Gods be thanked, I'm young!</span><br />
How may I change to please a Spartan scold?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Be anything you're not.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 9em;">You have not heard</span><br />
I am the admiral of the Spartan fleet,<br />
With Persian Phernes yonder at my beck,<br />
Broad-winged with all Phoenicia? You know not<br />
I am a general?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&nbsp;Oh, to be that name,</span><br />
Not make 't thy bauble! What dost know<br />
Of secret, sleepless hours, and delving thought<br />
That nations may lie safe? By what grave right<br />
Wear you the title? What deep sacrifice?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Leave sacrifice to fools and women! Ay,<br />
More lies are huddled in that saintly word<br />
Than ever smirked outside it. The strong soul<br />
Low bowing there, lies to his god,&mdash;the weak<br />
Lies to the world behind a holy shield<br />
That turns the spear of justice. Pallas, hear!<br />
A general makes himself a master, lest<br />
The State make him a servant.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">True in <em>Athens</em>!</span><br />
But you've another name. I've heard you called<br />
The young philosopher. Play you at that.<br />
'Twill tire naught but the tongue. Yours will go far.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Nay, spare me toil of spirit searching through<br />
Earth, sea, and sky for phrases magical<br />
To wrap creation in, as 'twere a babe<br />
Each man might call his own could he but find<br />
Some good-wife fancy to deliver it.<br />
No other hope?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 2em;"> &nbsp; They name you poet, too.</span><br />
Build round your spirit an Elysian cheat<br />
And buzz it through upon a golden wing.<br />
Is that not idle enough?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You touch me now</span><br />
With flattery's gold point. I wince and love<br />
The pain. Yet I'd not be a frolic breath<br />
At play with Spring and florets in the dew,<br />
Or move in rhym&egrave;d courtesies before<br />
The smile or frown of gods. Trick my dear soul<br />
In May-day rags to catch a languid eye.<br />
Babble of moods and minds, how some think this,<br />
Some that, and some have never thought. Drone how<br />
On such a day one struck another down,<br />
Or led a fleet, or laid a city wall.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> What would you sing then, pray?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 13em;">I would not sing.</span><br />
Was there not poetry before men spake?<br />
I'd go behind the broidered veil we've wrought<br />
Before the face of one that we loved much<br />
And then forgot for beauty of the shroud.<br />
The old lere's lost, the new but irks our dream.<br />
We listen to ourselves, while round us ever<br />
Are worlds that vainly pluck us to their doors,<br />
Giving us sign in lightning, heat, and wave,<br />
In flake of snow, flint-spark, and crystal rock,<br />
In stones that make the iron creep, and color,<br />
Fair flag and challenge to our shuttered minds.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Moving nearer</em>] Oh!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Seeming to forget her</em>]<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Round our lives is life whose destiny</span><br />
Is that frontier no word of ours has crossed,<br />
But man to come shall plant and harvest there,<br />
Where his soul sets the plough.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Softly</em>] You know that too?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> That life shall warm his barest common way<br />
Of in and out. In field and market-place,<br />
He'll lay his cheek 'gainst its unbodied love<br />
And flush translations of its silent touch.<br />
Then will be poets! Thought that now must fail<br />
In bird-wing flight, shall from a violet's eye<br />
O'erlook the sun. Till then I will not sing.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Not fight, philosophize, or sing!<br />
What's left for an Athenian?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Remembering her</em>] Love, fair Pyrrha!<br />
You know the tale how Chaos once uncurled<br />
Her laboring bulk from round a fire-leafed rose<br />
And sent its petals drifting down to fields<br />
Where mortals foot with chance? Whoso they touch<br />
Are lovers always, and one came to me.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Now here's ambition! And you live for that?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Ay there's the charm contents me with dull earth,<br />
And puts a rainbow in my listless hand.<br />
The way is pleasant if the road be love's,<br />
And I'd not shorten it by one maid's eye.<br />
To be a lover,&mdash;that's the graceful thing.<br />
Then one moves velvetly, forgets no curve,<br />
And lives his picture, line and color true.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> That r&ocirc;le's struck from your play, you'll find, my lord.<br />
Maidens will smile, but scorn will set the lip,<br />
And women's eyes be warm, but hate their fire<br />
For you, the traitor.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Traitor?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>In the door</em>] See the gleam<br />
On Athens, yours no more. The softest breast<br />
Within her walls is steel when you are named.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> But there are maids in Sparta.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Not for you,</span><br />
A traitor to the soil that gave you life.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> That soil first cast me off.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 9em;">A mother strikes</span><br />
Her child, but should the child return the blow<br />
Gods would droop eyes and blush.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> <span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">But were I true</span><br />
To my own land, I should be false to yours.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> A virtue that. A maid might love you then.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> A Spartan maid?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">A Spartan maid. But now</span><br />

<p><em>Hie.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">But we'll light ours!</span><br />
Three cressets&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Stopping him</em>] Wait! The event's too great<br />
To helve with such slight word. That snivelling blab<br />
May've lied, or crossed the signals, for the young<br />
Are easiest dyed in craft, and take its hue<br />
As natively as innocence doth wear<br />
Its smile in sleep.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> What then?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">You'll go to Phernes.</span></p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> There are no boats.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Tut, take the boats that brought</span><br />
Those purfled cymlings here. Their rowers too.<br />
Ah, Biades, you'll serve us still. And thought<br />
To trap all Sparta with this tip-toe bait!<br />
We have a saying. "Wit against the world,&mdash;"<br />
And there's another too, "The last lie wins."<br />
Hast heard it, Biades? We'll bear your word<br />
To Phernes that with dawn you move with him<br />
Upon the Athenian sails.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">He'll hear no word</span><br />
From Spartan mouth. So 'twas agreed between us,<br />
To annul such move as this if chance should strip<br />
My bent of cover. I alone may reach<br />
His ear with Sparta's prayer.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">We'll cast for proof</span><br />
Of that. If true, we shall remember, sir,<br />
That Sparta has won cities with no aid<br />
From Persia.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> You'll not go alone to meet<br />
The strength of Athens?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your far-wing&egrave;d name</span><br />
And sea-born battle-skill shall go with us.<br />
Your single arm's no loss, but in your fame,<br />
Yet ours to use, the Spartan strength<br />
Is doubled. Ha! They call us landmen,&mdash;say<br />
We must have feet on ground ere we can fight.<br />
But you they fear, bred to the wave, and first<br />
Of their commanders.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     &nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Let me die, but leave</span><br />
My name unmurdered.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">It shall be outflung</span><br />
In challenge to the Athenians. They know well<br />
The sailor rabble loves you, and will oppose<br />
But half a heart to Biades. Some too,<br />
Of higher place, believe you wronged, and fear<br />
The angered gods will station on your side.<br />
By spearman Ares, you shall keep the oath<br />
Great-sworn on Sparta's ground, to set her lance<br />
Through Athens' triple shield! Ay, though you lie<br />
In irons waiting death.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">The sunken souls</span><br />
Of deepest, damn&egrave;d Dis have never borne<br />
So vile a sting! You can not mean it, Pyrrha.<br />
Cast on my soul what Pluto would disbar<br />
From his fire-vaulted hell? I'll proudly die<br />
For treachery to you, but clear my name<br />
To Athens. Take not life and honor too!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> One you may save,&mdash;your life.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 12em;">What do you say?</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Draw Phernes back to us, and you shall live.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> You offer me but death, knowing I could not live<br />
A traitor.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> You choose to die as one?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Oh, Zeus,</span><br />
All-giver, hear!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 3em;">What gain is death to you</span><br />
If reputation dies eternally<br />
In Athens' hate? Sparta will do as much<br />
As spare your life.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Nay&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">She shall nothing know</span><br />
Of this hour's lapse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">O, bitter stars! O, Death</span><br />
Past fatal!&mdash;reaching o'er thy charnel bound<br />
To usurp the immortal garden! Die a traitor!<br />
Never will dew from a forgiving eye<br />
Fall on my grave!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Nor will the upbraiding gaze<br />
Of Heaven be more tender. For you chose<br />
To risk your country's life on turn of chance,<br />
Having no surety that drawn to danger<br />
You then could pluck her out. Ah, made her fate<br />
Your stake at dice, because, escaped the hazard,<br />
You'd toss with her to fortune! And your guilt<br />
Is heavy in her fall as though your hand<br />
Bore down her last defence and fierce untrussed<br />
Her heart to th' wolvish air.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Oh, Pyrrha, Pyrrha!</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Then why haste on to death? The noblest shades<br />
Will make no room for you where'er they walk.<br />
Why rush through the first gate to meet their cold<br />
Immortal scorn?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">But life with honor gone!</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> If death could buy it, then 'twere wise<br />
To buy so goldenly. But that's too late.<br />
Choose life,&mdash;with honor such as Sparta lays<br />
On those who serve but her. This treachery<br />
That we've by hap unbagged in 'ts eanling hour<br />
Shall be safe snugged again. And cherished too!<br />
For in my eyes it is the one brave flower<br />
Of your most barren being. None shall know it,<br />
And Sparta, as she will, may laurels weave<br />
About your faith.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> But Hieron?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>To Hieron</em>] You'll swear with me? [<em>He hesitates</em>]<br />
In Sparta's name? [<em>Takes his hand</em>] And mine?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 15em;">No, no!</span></p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> I'll swear.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh, not that price! No, till the end</span><br />
O' the world!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Life, Biades, life!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I will not do it!</span><br />
Athens may singly conquer!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Then you die</span><br />
By Sparta's hand, and Athens holds your name<br />
Accursed through time. The irons, Hieron.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Biades hunches despairingly, his face hidden</em>]</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Apart</em>] Gods! He will yield!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Looking up</em>] I'll do it,&mdash;dare to live,&mdash;<br />
And Attica may call me what she will.<br />
A traitor breathes, and feels the blessed sun.<br />
He's ne'er so poor but can his housing find<br />
In alms-lapped Nature. Her unchoosing airs<br />
Ask not his name before they touch his brow<br />
And tell him when 'tis spring. He yet may dream<br />
In unrebuking shades, and birds will sing<br />
As liquidly as though he were not by.<br />
Food is yet food, and wine is ever wine.<br />
I will not die. [<em>Rises</em>] By Maia's son, I'll live!<br />
What is my country but the bit of earth<br />
Where chance did spawn me? 'Tis no treachery.<br />
We're traitors unto love, not hate,&mdash;to trust,<br />
Not doubt and slander such as Athens poured<br />
Upon me guiltless.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Crossing to him</em>] So you've found a way<br />
To save both life and honor!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">May a worm</span><br />
Not creep to cleaner dust? Pyrrha, be kind.<br />
Spare me the trampling foot.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">We've lost an hour.</span><br />
You'll send to Phernes?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">First we'll signal him.</span><br />
He may be setting off. We must despatch,<br />
For if he saw no sign he meant to draw<br />
His fleet from doubtful waters and give aid<br />
To neither side. [<em>Taking up a light</em>]<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Three cressets&mdash;that was true.</span><br />
When once these lights have spoken, he'll receive<br />
Your envoy as myself. Then Hieron<br />
May bear confirming word to him, and bring<br />
Assurance back.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> [<em>To Pyrrha</em>] You do not doubt?</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Doubt now?</span><br />
Nay, Hieron. I'll trust him with his <em>life</em>.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Trembling</em>] O, ye gazing gods, must it be done?<br />
In Athens' living heart set up the torch<br />
That leaves her a charred blotch where she lay white<br />
'Neath heaven and smiled up to sister stars!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Come, Biades!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Shall not the earth be lost</span><br />
To God's own eye when Athens, quenched, no more<br />
Marks where we wander? I can not do it!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Taking the cresset</em>] Too late,<br />
My lord!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Fixes light in the open embrasure, then places two others.
Biades falls back, mantling his face</em>]</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> To Phernes now! We must not boggle this!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> If you've a doubt, sir, look on that. [<em>Points to Biades</em>]</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em> I'll hasten back to you.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 9em;">But note our light.</span><br />
The galley rowers may return ere you,<br />
And move us to the east.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I shall not lose you.</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> What escort will you take? A noble one<br />
Will best please Phernes.</p>

<p><em>Hie.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Mirador and Agis</span><br />
Shall go with me. Meanthes shall remain<br />
To be your watch.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">You'll tell them nothing?</span></p>

<p><em>Hie.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Sir,</span><br />
I've sworn. I shall say naught but this. That Athens<br />
Proffered you pardon, and you hold to Sparta.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Exit Hieron. Pyrrha watches from the door until the
boats put off. The sea is now dark. Biades takes up
a harp and strums it</em>]</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Turning</em>] You can do that? And I&mdash;I held my heart<br />
At halt, there at the door, nor turned my head<br />
Lest pity should emburn my eyes to tears. [<em>Crosses to him</em>]<br />
Dost know that all the juniper in the world,<br />
Burnt in thy house of honor, would not cleanse<br />
Its doors of stench? [<em>Throws the harp aside</em>]<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And you can use that air</span><br />
For breath of song!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Those are the bitterest words<br />
That ever dropped me gall, but I can find<br />
A crush&egrave;d balsam in them,&mdash;for they say<br />
You might have loved me, Pyrrha.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">I might.</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 14em;">You did.</span><br />
The moment that I cast my Spartan mask<br />
And showed me true to Athens, you were mine.<br />
That instant there was joy-fall on your heart<br />
That swept its icy sentinels with fire,<br />
And they were down. Oh, had I then proved staunch,<br />
Ta'en helmet off to death and bade him strike,<br />
You would have closed my eyes with kisses warm<br />
As rose-drift on a tomb&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Nay, I'd have kept</span><br />
Those eyes to be my light on earth, not star<br />
Elysian skies. Had fought for you against<br />
My mother Sparta. Fought as woman fights<br />
For her one love,&mdash;with wit and arm&egrave;d tongue,<br />
And cunning that throws puzzle on the gods.<br />
Fought till subdu&egrave;d Death had knelt to Fate<br />
And prayed your life for me!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Have I lost that?</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> You yielded&mdash;sank&mdash;unlustred even your soul<br />
For a poor pinch of time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">But if some touch</span><br />
Of heaven could make me true again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Look on</span><br />
Those lights, that you with single breath could turn<br />
To weeping smoke,&mdash;they've lit a quenchless wreck<br />
That all your sighs blow vain against,&mdash;a flame<br />
Ungovernable to remorse. Not furrowing winds<br />
That split the watery fields to Thetis' bed,<br />
And make a foamy Ural of her shore,<br />
Can sweep it out. Ay, groan and shake,<br />
And draw your mantle up! Behind a cover<br />
Thick as Taygetus' sides, I'd see you limned<br />
In shame!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Springing up</em>] What's shame to love? To love fire-sprung<br />
From instant meeting of fore-strangered eyes?<br />
And such was ours, there in that Athens' grove.<br />
Imperial of itself, it asks no loan<br />
Of subject virtue's smock to drape it royal.<br />
As fen-born vapors seem to nest the stars,<br />
Yet far below them do but thatch the world<br />
When they look down, the vassal qualities<br />
May lift no touch to love, that yet must wear,<br />
To earth's unvantaged eyes, their reek and hue.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Aerial love is but an earthling still,<br />
It must come down for food or mortal die,<br />
And what but virtues feed it?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Nay, you speak</span><br />
Of a fair, lesser thing,&mdash;a grace not lit<br />
From thurible in uncreated Hand,<br />
But coaxed from clay to a persuaded life.<br />
Garbed as the days,&mdash;patched, plastered, hung with dear<br />
Possessive vanities, it serves to make<br />
Contentment's bed, and cook a patient meal<br />
On comfort's hearth,&mdash;even snuggles in the void<br />
That else might ache, sings low, and makes<br />
Companioned feet tread bravely to the grave.<br />
It has a thousand names, but never one<br />
Is love. Be thine that white, ungendered spark,<br />
And naught can feed it, naught can make it less.<br />
Virtue and vice, nobility and shame,<br />
Are rags that drop away, while you sweep on,<br />
Stripped as a flame, with arms about your star.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Pyrrha is silent. Both start at sound of a noise on the water</em>]</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> What sound is that?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">The rowers are returning.</span></p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> So quietly?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Goes to door and closes it</em>]<br />
&nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">The world shall not come in</span><br />
On me and you. Be mine this broken hour,<br />
And Hieron may flute through after-time<br />
At secret doors where you lock up your favors.<br />
For you will go with him.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">A prophet too?</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> You'll make his home, but I shall come and go<br />
The unseen master there.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Now for the vision!</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> You'll watch your door,&mdash;the unheard step is mine,&mdash;<br />
And rock the babe born of a dream of me.<br />
And I, far-wandered, lost unto myself,<br />
Shall never lose you, Pyrrha. As the light<br />
Wrapping the wave reveals its silver dance,<br />
My being shall exult through shade and wear<br />
The chlamys of your gleam. Your voice behind<br />
The wind shall draw me lover-lipped to meet<br />
Adventure's breath. You'll lie upon the hush<br />
That girdles evening,&mdash;be the thrill within<br />
The throstle's note, and silence when<br />
His song is done.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nay, it will speak of Phania,</span><br />
Of Sybaris.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> Ay, and a hundred more<br />
In whom I've sought for thee, my Pyrrha, always thee!<br />
'Twill speak of them as statues speak of shards<br />
About their feet,&mdash;the sculptor's broken dreams<br />
That made the perfect one.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Those sounds&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Kneels</em>] Hear <em>me</em>! My head<br />
I'll votive lay till you may set your feet<br />
Like tangled roses in my curls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Pyrrha springs toward the door, but Biades is before her.

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Aside!</span><br />
I'll pass!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> O, save our bones. I am the stronger.<br />
You know 't.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> You! I'll wind you like a thread!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> You didn't.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Faithful and fleet as ever bore</span><br />
An Athenian general home. They came upon<br />
Your signal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> Mine?</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> They lay at watch, not Phernes.<br />
Look on those lights! O, trinal star, set high<br />
By my beloved! My honor's flaming hedge&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 14em;">You fly,</span><br />
But in a net! The Spartans heard those shouts.<br />
They are in chase&mdash;you'll see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 10em;">They're unprepared.</span><br />
The captains off their ships, the guards in doubt,<br />
And oarsmen half asleep. But let them come<br />
Far as they dare, and if they dare too far<br />
From Persia's shelter, the Athenian fleet<br />
Will close like jaws about them.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Sits, with sudden hopelessness</em>] You have won,<br />

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 7em;">I'll not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>    <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Yes, love, you will.</span><br />
There is a dagger hangs in Phelas' shop,<br />
Shall be your bridal gift. A priz&egrave;d blade<br />
Of coppered gold, hued like a battle morning.<br />
Smooth-cheeked as Artemis, although inlaid<br />
With pictured tale. A captured Amazon,<br />
Wrought palely in alloy,&mdash;a silvered fear<br />
On th' bronzen flush of courage,&mdash;bows before<br />
Her conqueror, a knight who gently bends<br />
As I do now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>Thrusting him off</em>] No! Never! I'll not trust<br />
Your dolphin nature! Long as fish have fins<br />
You'll sport in every sea! Go&mdash;go to Phania!</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> [<em>Turns angrily from her</em>] Ay, by my gods that I have found again,<br />

I will not live! I'll leap into the sea!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em> [<em>On her elbow, as he reaches door</em>]<br />

A brocket yet, his antlers barely bossed.<br />
My oath upon it, your reshaping hand<br />

Has moved behind our own?</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I think it so.</span><br />
Our aim achieves its heaven, though we smart<br />
Beneath it. To the outer glozing fame<br />

Inmost applause. When we exchanged our babes,<br />
'Twas for this end and day, and had we held<br />
To our first intent and taken our own again,<br />

<p><em>Ste.</em> What haste, good Agis? Goes the world so fast?</p>

<p><em>Pel.</em> [<em>Who has been listening to Menas</em>]<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">You hear it, Stesilaus!</span><br />
Athens is ashes! We're betrayed, betrayed!</p>

<p><em>Lys.</em> 'Tis known to all. The very curb cries out<br />

<p><em>A Spartan.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though the heart of Athens</span><br />

<p><em>Menas.</em> And bared the tale, made his by accident,<br />
And swore you knew it too,&mdash;that Pyrrha there<br />

Of Spartan Stesilaus.</p>

Too foul to keep.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">You knew this, Biades?</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> And knew you would forgive!</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 11em;">This was the spring</span><br />

<p><em>Arc.</em>         <span style="margin-left: 14em;">My friends,</span><br />
I'm such a one as you do most contemn,&mdash;<br />
A woman disobedient to her lord.<br />
But if you judgment give upon that point,<br />

<p><em>Voices.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">What? What? Your child?</span></p>

<p><em>Amen.</em> Silence! Speak on, Archippe.</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 12em;">When she lay</span><br />
A morsel cradled, two months' breath in her,<br />
Came he, the father, swearing she must go<br />
To Sachinessa's breast, and I must take<br />
Her Phania to my own,&mdash;thereby to serve<br />
In some occulted way the future good<br />
Of Greece. And all the mercy won from him<br />
Was leave to journey with my child to Athens&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Sac.</em> But I was not so meek! By Pallas, no!<br />
What&mdash;who&mdash;was Pelagon, to rob my bosom<br />
Of Hera's gift? Who made him greater than<br />
The gods? 'Tis but a girl, he said, to me,<br />
A mother! I went to Philon then, the priest<br />
Whom Athens honors, and by holy counsel,<br />
We did not change our babes, but let our deed<br />
Wear face that pleased them, with a heart our own,<br />
And home Archippe went with Pyrrha safe,<br />
While I in Athens held my Phania close.<br />
And they, fond sires, who knew no difference<br />
Between a <em>girl</em> and <em>girl</em>, hugged their deep plan<br />
And built the phantom of united Greece<br />
Upon it.</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em> If those ghostly towers, now fallen,<br />
May rise again, it is our act, my lords,<br />
Provides them nature's base, and not a dream's.<br />
Condemn us, if you will, as erring wives,<br />
But as true mothers give us softer justice.<br />
And if there's scale or balance that can hold<br />
Such torturous weight, lay on it all the pain<br />
Of lonely years that saw me turn my face<br />
From my loved daughter, lest this man of rock<br />
Should know her mine and his.</p>

<p><em>Pyrr.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Your own, your own,</span><br />
My mother!</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em>           <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So you slip me, dame,</span><br />
And Pyrrha goes with you. But Biades<br />
Is under thumb by this same turn. He now<br />
Must know himself a Spartan, and shall keep<br />
My terms.</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em> Make them full easy. You shall lay<br />
No marring hand upon our children's joy<br />
As fell on mine.</p>

<p><em>Bia.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 3em;">O, sue for me, Archippe!</span><br />
Give me my bride! Whatever be her race,<br />
Her home is in my arms!</p>

<p><em>Arc.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Forgive him, Pyrrha.</span><br />
Not for his pleading, but for love I know<br />
You bear him.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Pyrrha permits Biades to embrace her</em>]</p>

<p><em>Alc.</em> [<em>To Phania</em>] Sweet, we know our heaven by<br />
Those moments in a hell.</p>

<p><em>Amen.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Here's feast enough!</span></p>

<p><em>Bia.</em> But poor old Creon in this rain of porridge<br />
Starves for a spoon.</p>

<p><em>Cre.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And you, perforce, take one</span><br />

<p><em>Bia.</em> I'm caught. But in love's lap.<br />
I'll swallow Sparta for so dear a bed.</p>

<p><em>Menas.</em> And you need fear no distaff tyranny,<br />
My lord. There you are safe. Although your bride<br />
Be Hera-limbed, you've proved yourself her Zeus<br />
In open match.</p>

<p><em>Cre.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 3em;">How if her mov&egrave;d heart</span><br />
Crept to her arm and slipped the victory<br />
Unwon to love?</p>

To their deceit?</p>

<p><em>Philon.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Whoso reveres the gods</span><br />
Draws of their strength in every mortal inch,<br />
And in this act I did them reverence,<br />
Standing between their wish and meddling wits<br />
Of these presumptive men. But pardon them.<br />
For it is shame enough to've thought to make<br />
A frislet of their own shake like the locks<br />
Of cloud-haired Zeus. For me, my hand is on<br />
My altar, and I fear no fall.</p>

<p><em>Amen.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">No more,</span><br />
Good Philon.</p>

<p><em>Philon.</em> Ay, a word, This morning, sir,<br />
I blessed the couple here, knowing them free<br />
Of kindred blood,&mdash;Alcanor and his Phania.<br />
The strands are doubly woven that now bind<br />
Sparta and Athens. Pyrrha and Biades<br />
Were first to link them one, and now this pair<br />
Unites them o'er.</p>

<p><em>Amen.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 3em;">You hear, my Spartan friends.</span><br />
What say you? Is it peace?</p>

<p><em>Spartans.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Peace be to Athens!</span></p>

<p><em>Amen.</em> And peace to Sparta! Hearts and altars guard it!<br />
Go, citizens! See that the chariots<br />
Glow with new garlands for this double bridal.<br />
And let the noble wives of these proud lords<br />
Co-queen festivity. All shall rejoice<br />
Save this convicted pair,&mdash;you, Pelagon,<br />
And Stesilaus. You we prison here,<br />
Your own sole company, nor shall you speak<br />
Save in a rhyme now dim with little use,<br />
But shall be better known from this day forth<br />
With polish you shall give it. Hear it, sirs:</p>

open rear, through which is seen a sunset sky, leads to a parapet
overlooking the city of Avesta and the coast of Suli. Entrances right

<p><em>Char.</em> O, sea-washed city, must the hail of fire<br />
Crimson thy milky walls, and salt winds strive<br />
In vain to sweeten ditches dark with blood<br />
From thy tapped heart? Come, Barca, be my eyes,<br />
Who climbs the heights?</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Barca advances and looks over</em>]</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Lords Vigard and Biondel<br />
Are on the pass.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">My sons so soon returned!</span><br />
No other?</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Farther down, my lord, I see<br />
The knight, Sir Vairdelan.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Then we shall hear</span><br />
His sunset song.</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> The stairway through the cliff<br />
Is closed. Shall I give signal, sir, to hoist<br />
The upper gate?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">That is my charge henceforth. [<em>Going left</em>]</span><br />
They will be hungered. [<em>Turns to Barca</em>]<br />

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Gaina enters, right, rear, carrying a tray piled with candles</em>]</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> Thank goodness, Barca, you're where you're
wanted for once! Help me with these winkers. [<em>Giving
him candles</em>] My mistress kept me out on the cliffs when
I ought to 'a' been inside an hour ago doing my honest
work. I got her in at last, but I had to be round with
her, poor soul! I told her what!</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> [<em>Placing candles</em>] She was watching for her
brothers?</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> [<em>Puts tray down</em>] Brothers! It was a sight of
that singing knight she wanted. He went down the pass
this morning and she has gone about all day like a bird
with a sore throat.</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> God gave her eyes, and Sir Vairdelan is good to
see. When I look at him I feel somehow as if the sun
were just up and everybody had another chance.</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> A man who lets his sword rust at home while
he goes about tootle-de-rooling on a flute! And she could
be the princess of Avesta if she'd look in the right place.
Well, if she had <em>my</em> eyes!</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> What! You would have your mistress marry
Banissat? An unbeliever?</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> A prince is a prince,&mdash;and I'd say the same if
my mistress were my own daughter.</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> And you a Christian!</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> A Christian of Corinth, I'd have you know.
There are Christians and Christians, please you! And
for my mistress, dear heart, it would take more than
marrying a prince to send her to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Let it out.</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> Hell, then,&mdash;if you want to bite ginger. And
who but Banissat can stand between her father and that
English Oswald&mdash;who is just plain devil and not an Englishman
at all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Devil? A knight of the Cross leading the army
of the Lord to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> Nobody but the devil, I tell you! And I
wouldn't speak to him if I met him walking with Saint
Peter, unless he showed me his bare feet with ten good
toes on 'em. It might be all right for Peter, but a woman
can't be too careful, and the master took me out of a good
family in Corinth. And this Vairdelan who is no more a
knight than I'm a lady&mdash;the next time he goes down the
pass he will lose his way up again, or my head's a goose-egg,
that's all!</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Gently, Gaina. You were young once.</p>

<p><em>Gaina.</em> Once? I've more hairs than wrinkles yet, which
some can't say and tell the truth!</p>

<p><em>Barca.</em> Tongue in! Here's the master. [<em>Moves right</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ah, not one guard</span><br />

<p><em>Char.</em> The only guard is always near,&mdash;<br />
A fearless heart.</p>

What I may share is his.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>    &nbsp;   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Here's living hope!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> He, like myself, was cloister-bred, and passed<br />
Peaceful, uncounted days until the death<br />
Of his three brothers, slain in one mad hour.<br />
Earl Oswald then bethought him of the son<br />
So early given to Christ. "I have no heir,"<br />
He said, "but God lacks not for monks." And straight<br />
With power and gold bought full release for Bertrand,<br />
Save that release his soul and God might give.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> You make me love his story.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 11em;">True to peace</span><br />
Even in the camp of war, he lives withdrawn,<br />
And so gives Rumor sweep for what she would,<br />
While in her swollen report the earl conceals<br />
His monkish son's true nature.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I'll know this youth!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> He keeps his tent by day, and steals at night<br />
To forest glens, his armor but a cloak,<br />
His sword a flute&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">O, light from Heaven!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Sometimes</span><br />
He farther goes, even far as Kidmir heights,<br />
And at the feet of Charilus he learns<br />
A love more true than fane and cloister taught,&mdash;<br />
The love that made the houseless, barefoot Christ,<br />
With open breast to all unbrothered woe,&mdash;<br />
And now he kneels and of that gentlest love<br />
Asks pardon.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Bertrand, son of Oswald, rise.<br />
There's no forgiving in the sinless star.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Rising, to Ardia</em>] And you?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Ah ... when I've breath!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 9em;">What I have said,</span><br />
My lord, makes way for what is yet to say.<br />
To-day I waited by Avesta's gate<br />
For this [<em>taking out paper</em>] my father's word, response to mine<br />
Sent days ago to him. Here, sir, he says: [<em>Reads</em>]</p>

<p>"Son of my hope, your words are not more strange to me than these I
write with my own hand. If Charilus will come to Suli Castle, the which
my swords have taken while you sang and slept, my door shall open to him
as Kidmir gates have opened unto you. By Christ, I swear the treatment
that he gave my blood he shall have again from me. But if he come not
down, then shall I reach him through Avesta's heart, and the love he now
spurns will be cold in my sword. Despatch this, I pray you, for I would
hasten to Jerusalem, leaving you my conquered princedom, whose head is
Ilon and whose foot is the city of Ramoor. Thine as thy heart speaks,
Oswald."</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Your father's hand?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Doubt flies from it, although</span><br />
The vein is alien, sir. It is his hand.<br />
And, I do think, his heart, wherein, my lord,<br />
Your gentleness to me, like creeping rain,<br />
Has moistened love's dry root, whose pent-up bloom<br />
Is by that nurture freed, and magical<br />
Now glows before us.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">This I would believe. [<em>Starts off right</em>]</span><br />
Vigard and Biondel must have this news<br />
From my slow lips, lest with the sudden truth<br />
They strike ablaze. They have their mother's fire.<br />

<p><em>Osw.</em> Too soft, my warrior. Keep such woman's play<br />
For Berenice. She will thank you for it.<br />
I'm rough and old, and need the soldier clap<br />
To start the singing blood. [<em>Clapping Bertrand</em>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A blow with good</span><br />
Red heart in 't!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Berenice?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ah, that takes you!</span><br />
She's here at last. Prince Frederick arrived<br />
Three days ago, and with him his fair daughter,<br />
Too dear of value to be left behind,<br />
The prey of quarrelling kings. You'll dance with her<br />
To-night.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> You'll pardon me. I shall not dance.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Faugh, there's the monk again! Why, boy, we'll pray<br />
The better for a little tripping,&mdash;fight<br />
The better too. One dance with Berenice!<br />
A beauty, sir, who makes me hate the years<br />
That lie 'tween youth and me. She was to wed<br />
A son of mine by vow above her cradle,<br />
And I have buried every son save you.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> May I not keep one vow?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">The pope long since</span><br />
Released you. Now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">My compact was with Christ.</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Why cling to one when all the rest are broken?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> It is the one lies wholly in my choice.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> You left your cell.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Do you forget 'twas you</span><br />
Who shook to ground my cloister walls, and locked<br />
All holy doors against me?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">True, I did it.</span><br />
And with good warrant. Broadest Christendom<br />
Upheld my right and gave me back my heir.<br />
Small gain if you refuse to wed. My need<br />
Is not for sons but grandsons now. My boy,<br />
You'll let me see your children at my knee?<br />
Ho, hide your face? Then there's a heart in you.<br />
Why should I toil through blood and groans and fire<br />
To make a name my shroud will wrap with me?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Toil then to give this land to God, and live<br />
So long as love shall live in men.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Pale fame!</span><br />
Have you no blood of mine? How could my fire<br />
Father this sluggish monk? There was a maid<br />
On Kidmir, Charilus' daughter, who has come<br />
In wag of him, which speaks a fearless wench,&mdash;<br />
She taught you nothing in those moons you passed<br />
Upon her peaks?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sir?</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">When I saw her face</span><br />
Flash from her veil, I could have sworn<br />
Your vow was drowned in her lake-eyes, and that<br />
Her captured softness had made easy way<br />
For royal Berenice. Now you talk<br />
Out of your cowl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Not so! I am a knight!<br />
Your words have made me one! Now could I draw<br />
This sword that knows not blood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">I'll bout with thee</span><br />
For any woman. Come! Thou'lt be a man<br />
Ere long. Come, sir!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">You've set a foot most foul</span><br />
Upon the flower of time!</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">It seems I've hit</span><br />
The mark i' the very eye.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">The whitest thought</span><br />
That holds her first must shrive itself!</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">So, so!</span><br />
Come, end the song. She's yours. 'Tis not the moon<br />
You cry for, take an old man's word.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">The moon</span><br />
Were nearer to me!</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Trrr-rrr-rr!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">My lord?</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> A woman. Ask and have. I'll send her here.<br />
This is the hour to bait you, and I'd not lose it<br />
For half of Suli.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Stay! I will not see her.</span><br />
I dare not look upon her lest I lose<br />
Christ and myself.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Are you so tuned? We'll have</span><br />
A wedding yet.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Forget that word, and I<br />
Forgive you for it.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">A wedding, prince of Suli.</span><br />
This plain shall ring to Antioch.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Nay, father,&mdash;</span><br />
And yet I thank you that your heart would make<br />
So fair a maid my bride.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Fair? That's no word.</span><br />
She's glory's darling pearl,&mdash;the morning's eye<br />
That makes the night forgot! When you have seen her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> When I have seen her?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Ay,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Do you not speak</span><br />
Of Ardia?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Ardia! Gods! Wed Kidmir's trull?<br />
Make me a doting grandsire to the heir<br />
Of Charilus? Hear it, stars! Am I the fool<br />
O' the earth? Give up my English forests, bare<br />
My purse for troops, and foot by foot fight way<br />
To Suli sands,&mdash;all this that I may set<br />
A droning dotard's line upon a throne,<br />
And be the ass of chronicle? O, poison!<br />
Well, well, I'm done. The girl is fair enough.<br />
And you shall have her if she pleases you.<br />
But Berenice&mdash;there's your bride, my boy!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Wed Berenice? With that name you save me.<br />
By that I see the darkness coiling deep<br />
Along my bridal way. 'Twas Ardia's name<br />
That lit the path till I dared let my eyes,<br />
Though not my will, go venturing on 't.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">My son,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Never again, my father, speak to me<br />
In this night's strain. Till morning I shall pray.<br />
And then I fast. Good-night.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">One moment. One!</span><br />
The sunrise feast? Will you not be with us?<br />
I drink with Charilus the cup of peace.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> And love that breaks no peace?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> [<em>Assenting</em>] See how you bend me?<br />
All that you ask I give, but you to me<br />
Yield nothing.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Sir, this sword, my knightly suit,<br />
And princely title, make denial for me.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Your pardon. I forget you count it much<br />
To give a crust and cell for this broad kingdom.<br />
I who have paid my heart out for a crown<br />
Must thank you now to wear it.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Good-night.</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 13em;">O, son,</span><br />
Have you no patience with a man grown old<br />
In many battles? Now feel I my age,<br />
Knowing the dearest blows of my long life<br />
Have bought me but this shadow. In you is drained<br />
Ambition's heart,&mdash;my every burning aim<br />
Fails here in you, and cools unforged, unshapen.<br />
Yet do you turn from me as though 'twere I<br />
Not you who gave the wound that parts us.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 14em;">I?</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Of all my sons I loved you best. You think<br />
I gave you to the friars with no twinge<br />
Here at my heart? Your mother said "One son<br />
We must return to God," and I said "Yea,<br />
So it be not my Bertrand." But her will<br />
Ran 'gainst me. When she had her way, I longed<br />
Through many a day to have you at my side,<br />
While you were happy with your songs and saints,<br />
Your father quite forgot.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Stirred</em>] Nay, not forgot.<br />
And I am with you now.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">O, let me feel</span><br />
My son is mine! I'll yield you anything.<br />
Ay, even Ardia! She shall be my daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> By heaven that keeps me true, I will not hear<br />
That name again! There's maddest music in it.<br />
I see her when I hear it. [<em>Covering his eyes</em>]</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> [<em>Aside</em>]       <span style="margin-left: 2em;">I see the lime</span><br />
Will catch you.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Again, good-night.</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">One favor, son.</span><br />
And slight too, by 'r lady!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Speak it, sir.</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> I gave my word you'd wait on Berenice.<br />
I' faith, I know not what excuse to make<br />
To Frederick. 'Tis barest courtesy<br />
To give her greeting.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I will welcome her,</span><br />
Our guest.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Enough! [<em>Going</em>] You'll wait us here?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 15em;">I'll wait.</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Prince Bertrand?</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Rising</em>]   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">You?</span><br />
Not Berenice!</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Ah ... you wait for her?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Who brought you here?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">The earl. Your father.</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 13em;">He!</span><br />
What said he?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> That you prayed to see me, sir.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> O, faithless! He deceived you.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">I will go.</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Stay&mdash;tell me&mdash;how you fare.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Nay, you await</span><br />
The princess.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> You've all comfort? No least lack?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I've food and bed, but little company.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> My father's plans press hard, and I'm a part<br />
Of them. Each hour he calls me.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">I know, my lord,</span><br />
This is not Kidmir. I've my father too.<br />
You've yours ... and Berenice.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Nay, it seems</span><br />
Fate hath her changelings. You have come, not she.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I sought no meeting, sir, but being here,<br />
I'll ask you of my father. Is he safe?<br />
Earl Oswald means no treachery to his guest?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> At sunrise he will drink the cup of peace.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> That's hours away! He knows your life is pledged<br />
For Charilus' safety?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">No. I will not wake</span><br />
A doubt against his honor.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">He should know.</span><br />
I've seen his eyes. Good hap, you have your mother's.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> If he be vile as you so fear he is,<br />
My pledge would be no leash to his hold will.<br />
He'd chain me here till he destroyed your brothers.<br />
Let him know naught, I'm free to keep my oath.<br />
But this should not be spoken. We do wrong<br />
To talk of things that have no being save<br />
In our own midnight fears.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Well, I shall sleep.</span><br />
Good-night, my lord.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Am I not Vairdelan?</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Ay, when you smile so.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<em>Holds out her hands, and drops them untouched</em>]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Far, O far from Kidmir!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Yea, an eternal journey my lost soul<br />
May find it. Ardia, counsel me. Two ways<br />
Stretch long before me, and I faint<br />
In daring either. Give me of your strength.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> My strength? I have none.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">You have God's.</span><br />
Men, proud in valor, stray and lose his hand;<br />
The woman holds it ever, walking floods<br />
And trampling fire where men go down.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Tell me!</span><br />
How may I help you?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Sit then. I will speak.</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<em>She sits; He stands near her</em>]</span><br />
I have agreed to be the sovereign<br />
Of sword-won Suli.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">None will better serve</span><br />
Where he is master. O, this spear-torn land<br />
Shall flower to heaven and mate her bloom with stars!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> A bloom that dies with me?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Death cannot make</span><br />
The spirit barren.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>At distance</em>] Through me my father hopes<br />
To found a princely house o'er-topping Asia<br />
With Christ-lit towers.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Oh!... Then you will wed.</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>His eyes down</em>] My bride is chosen.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> [<em>Rising</em>]   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Chosen? [<em>Sits again</em>]</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nay.... I know....</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Returning</em>] Your hidden eyes hide not the loathing there<br />
For me forsworn. Why have I troubled you?<br />
Look on me, Ardia. I am not yet fallen.<br />
I take your answer. You have chosen my way,<br />
And I set forth upon it&mdash;<em>not</em> forsworn.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> That word is naught. I do not think of it.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Must man not keep his pledge?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">To mortals, yes.</span><br />
For so our lives are knit, and part to part<br />
Keep sound and whole. But pledges unto God<br />
Man cannot make or keep till he may bind<br />
The Will that journeys with the launch&egrave;d world.<br />
So might His rivers say "Here will we rest,<br />
And worship thee," nor run into the sea,<br />
And God must be content though all his fields<br />
Burn waterless. So might the winds vow Him<br />
Unbroken calm, and God who needs his storms<br />
Must still his own desire while his dear earth<br />
Goes pestilent.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Unsentient things! He shares<br />
His will with man.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> But not to enslave his own.<br />
Christ seals no bond the lips lay on the soul<br />
That is each instant new as life, as change,<br />
As the importuning world. Ah, he who sells<br />
To one hour's narrow need the zenith light<br />
Of unborn days would snuff out time and know<br />
No rising sun. Himself would be a slavedom<br />
Where never Christ would walk.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Is 't Ardia speaks?</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Truth speaks, not I. If man must vow,<br />
Let it not be to love no woman,&mdash;wear<br />
The vest of fire, and in a sunless cell<br />
Chain Heaven-arteried life,&mdash;then peering out,<br />
Cling to the nested eaves transfixed to see<br />
His fled desires wear the horizon flame.<br />
But let him vow his Christ shall shrink no vein<br />
Of broad and pauseless being; ay,&mdash;shall keep<br />
Sweet surgence with his blood, climb with his spirit<br />
Time's lifting hills, and hold in watch with him<br />
The unshrouding pinnacles where love puts off<br />
The old clouds for the dawn. Forsworn? O, heart<br />
Cell-bound, thy very vows deny thy Christ.<br />
Who serve him wear no chains.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 9em;">You think me true?</span><br />
And yet I felt your wounded, doubting eyes<br />
Raining me scorn. Why was it, Ardia?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Scorn?</span><br />
I have forgot why 'twas&mdash;or shall forget.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> And there was pity too, that dropped your lids.<br />
And would have sheltered me. Is that forgot?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Nay, that.... I'll tell you that. I thought of Love,<br />
Man's angel, and the heart-lone way of him<br />
Who missed and found her not. Never to take<br />
More courage from the fall of her sure feet<br />
On heights that wind between death and the stars;<br />
Or where his road burns through the shadeless sands,<br />
Reach for the hand with fountains in its touch<br />
And feel the palm-breath round him. Not to know<br />
Her eyes when night is come, and there's no star;<br />
Her breast, that pillowing the darkened waste,<br />
Keeps warm the bitten earth and gives him dream<br />
To meet and match the dawn. So wept my thoughts,<br />
Forgetting that you are no wanderer,<br />
But kingly housed will rule a tam&egrave;d realm.<br />
Or should a harvest come of spears, not grain,<br />
Yet is your princess brave and beautiful,<br />
And bears, may be, a mating heart. Love then<br />
Will come to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">My princess?</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Berenice.</span><br />
Your father's choice ... and yours.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">My Ardia! Mine!</span><br />
Could such a lie creep to your soul and find<br />
No lances at the door? [<em>Kneels, kissing her hands</em>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My love, my love, my love!</span><br />
Let honors fail, and stars forget my name,<br />
'Tis thou shalt walk beside me, thou my chosen!<br />
I'll hear thy footfall on the winter steep,<br />
And take thy hand where desert noons are white,<br />
But close thy breast shall lie upon my heart,<br />
Nor pillow the bitten waste, my own, my own!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<em>She moves from him. He rises</em>]</span><br />
Why are you silent, pale, and heaven-still?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I must be still. I've mourned my heart-walls thin.<br />
This joy will break them. Joy to hear your voice<br />
With love's mate-music in it cry to me.<br />
My joy! I'll drink it all, nor lose one drop,<br />
For I shall have no more.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">No more? No less</span><br />
Than life can hold!</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hear me, my lord.</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">You love me!</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I shall not be your wife.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">You're mine&mdash;all mine!</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> You hold your vow yet sacred, breaking it<br />
By the sole might of love. You do not feel<br />
The vision round you in whose light that vow<br />
Falls like a grave-cloth from an angel's limbs.<br />
Ah, Christ would be no bridal guest of ours,<br />
Shut out by your heart's fear.<br />

&nbsp; <span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<em>He stands as if stricken</em>]</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You see 'tis true.</span><br />
You listen for his sanction, and you hear<br />
The ring of your own vow.<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<em>He sits bowed</em>]</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You hear it now</span><br />
Above your passion's chime. 'Twill fill the air<br />
When love's mad bells grow quiet, and your soul<br />
Asks the old question. Let me then be far<br />
From thee, nor stay to be a clasp&egrave;d fire<br />
Eating thy side.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">You'll heal me of my fear.</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<em>Reaching his hands to her</em>]</span><br />

My fountain and my palm!</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Your doubt would stir</span><br />
Beneath your tenderest deep. My nearing step<br />
Would as a trumpet start its buried storm<br />
To sweep our meeting eyes.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">If Christ would give</span><br />
A sign,&mdash;leave me no choice,&mdash;no other way</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> The torch of Fate but blinds us when the heart<br />
Beareth no light.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not Fate, but Heaven&mdash;there</span><br />
I'd read my sign.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hope not, my lord, that Heaven</span><br />
Will drive me to your arms. Farewell.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">No, no!</span><br />
To keep you I'll dare hell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Dare hell? My love</span><br />
Walks not that fiery verge, but waits thine own<br />
In regions nearer God. There we shall meet,<br />
And there will be no hell.<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<em>Turns to go, but is drawn back by his grief</em>]</span><br />

&nbsp;  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Thou art a prince</span><br />
Of Christ. Arise and rule this land for him.<br />

You have the world to feed on, need not eat<br />
Your heart as I must&mdash;I, the woman. Dear,<br />
Where Kidmir cliffs climb highest to the sky<br />
I'll keep my watch, but thou shall rise above me<br />
In thought of men. O'er all discerning shall<br />
Thy purpose wing, perhaps be drunk of clouds,<br />
But light shall follow where thine aim has sped,<br />
And leading upward with your comrade world,<br />
My Kidmir shall seem lowly, where I walk<br />
With stintless ache beneath the cedar boughs<br />
On pain's moon nights. And oh, the Springs to pass,<br />
When each bride-bud shall be a wound to me,<br />
When grasses young, and softly pushing moss,<br />
Shall urge my feet like fire, and I must stand<br />
Quite still ... quite still ... with all my unborn babes<br />
Dead in my heart.</p>

For I had wondrous dreams.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">You speak of dreams?</span><br />
A magic touched me, and I woke from dream<br />
Knowing my life. What ways we went! All things<br />
Seemed new, warm with the Maker's hand, as young<br />

That kept them sweet, unaging.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">It was Love</span><br />

'Tween sea and dawn! The leaves that turn i' the wind<br />

<p><em>Ber.</em> Walking the light between the parted stars,<br />

The eternal joy within it. Twas a world<br />

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">If that could be!</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> What seers, what eyes of light, outshone the pain<br />
That gave them being! Tears that silvered graves<br />
Globed in their pearl the immortal hope of men,<br />
And seemed as beautiful as prophecy<br />
Burning in its own truth. Ay, where a man<br />
Fell murdered, crying "I forgive," the ground<br />
Sprang as a garden&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Murdered? O, not that!<br />
How could you say it? I had forgot, forgot!<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<em>Bertrand stands speechless</em>]</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Now, my lords,</span><br />
Since he no longer brays, I have a tale<br />
To tell you. I, too, had a father, though<br />
The world has long forgot him.</p>

<p><em>Fred.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">No, my friend.</span><br />
Well do I bear in mind his fair, proud face,<br />
And glory of his arms.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">He was struck down</span><br />
Because a minion, straying from the hearth,<br />
Looked on his beauty with her nestling eyes.</p>

<p><em>Fred.</em> For no more cause?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I swear it. Friends, if death</span><br />
Were the cold price for kissing of a jade,<br />
Who here would be alive? For so slight sin<br />
Was my brave father murdered. Charilus, speak!<br />
Was not the princely heart of John of Clyffe<br />
Ripped with a hate-keen sword,&mdash;the sword of him<br />
Who claimed the lordship of those rebel lips<br />
That chose my father liege?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">It is too true.</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Who better knows? Say that a wilding flies<br />
The builded bower, hearing a lordlier song<br />
Pass on the wind than her dull mate can tune,<br />
Must then the singer die, who scarcely knows<br />
His song is heard, or that a bold wing follows?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Whether the earl of Clyffe sang then to woo,<br />
As I believe, or for the love of song,<br />
As you do say, my lord,&mdash;his death was sin,<br />
And he who wrought that woe shed tears enough<br />
To clear his stain, if tears may whiten souls.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> A murderer's tears! But what of mine, the son's?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Your oath&mdash;your honor, sir! Where is the love<br />
You swore should cleanse your shield?</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Safe in my heart.</span><br />
And burning for my father.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">God of pity!</span></p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> That was the love I spoke of.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">All be deaf</span><br />
But hell!</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> Hear the full tale, my friends. I swear<br />
The earl of Clyffe died for no more offence<br />
Than I have here set out,&mdash;and I, his only son,<br />
Kissed his red wounds and from his breast unbound<br />
This bloody scarf&mdash; [<em>taking scarf from his bosom</em>] that then was crimson, now<br />
In age-grown black bemourns my step that comes<br />
So sluggish to revenge. For thirty years<br />
Had passed ere I beheld his murderer,<br />
Then face to face we stood ... and face to face<br />
We stand ... for this is he, this Charilus<br />
Of Kidmir&mdash;peace-lipped Cain&mdash;gray hypocrite,<br />
Whose blood is honey in his veins, whose eyes<br />
Stare on the world as he were some bland god<br />
Who made it and said "good."</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Sir, I would send</span><br />
My daughter to her brothers. Grant me this.<br />
And I am ready for what death you please.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I will not go. One sword shall strike us both.<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<em>Turns to Oswald</em>]</span><br />

But first a word to you. When Charilus falls,<br />
Say farewell to your son. He pledged his life<br />
To my two brothers for our father's safety,<br />
And you, who know him least, yet know he'll keep<br />
That pledge.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em> What, creature, will you lie?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 11em;">I speak</span><br />
The truth. Strike, if you can, this gray old man,<br />
Silvered in service to the one high God,<br />
Sinless as sunlight, fair in sweetened age,&mdash;<br />
Let forth his sainted blood, and Bertrand lives<br />
No longer than the shortest time between<br />
Suli and Kidmir.</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">That's a lifetime then!</span><br />
He shall not step! I'll have him hung with chains<br />
Till he is fast as rooted oaks in earth!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Stunned</em>] A guest betrayed....</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Betrayed? I promised him</span><br />
Such treatment as he gave my blood. And he<br />
Shall have it&mdash;death!</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Peace be my heir!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> [<em>Takes stand by Charilus</em>] Death, sir?<br />
First break this sword! Thy sin must be unnamed<br />
Until the angel who doth write thee damned<br />
Gives it foul christening. I break my pledge.<br />
I will not go to Kidmir. Here I'll give<br />
My life for Charilus.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">No blow for me!</span><br />
O, may I unaveng&egrave;d lie forgot,<br />
And my forgiving blood make barren ground<br />
Alive with asphodel&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Nay, I will strike,</span><br />
Though a father's sword meet mine!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Charilus trembles, and supports himself by Ardia's arm</em>]</p>

<p><em>Osw.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Commend me, stars!</span><br />
You counselled well. [<em>To Bertrand</em>] Fool, do not draw. There's none<br />
Will run against you. Charilus is dead,<br />
And by a way more sure. His holy goblet<br />
Held one rich drop the angels put not there<br />
Nor Virgin blessed. See how he pales&mdash;and stares&mdash;<br />
And cannot get his voice? So are we spared<br />
A swan-song homily trickling through his beard.<br />

Where God may sit with us and map the winds<br />
That forward blow and back, the paths laid free<br />

Would we know Heaven we must listen here,<br />

<p><em>Ber.</em>     <span style="margin-left: 12em;">A guard</span><br />

<p><em>Ber.</em> And killed. Look on this blade.<br />
 &nbsp;    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">A brother's blood.</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> O, me! I too shall die. And that is best,<br />
If anything we do be worst or best.<br />
I've read within my father's secret script<br />
That earth shall lose its heart of fire, and lie<br />
Dead-cold and dark with no green thing upon it.<br />
Then this black crust shall bear no form of man,<br />
Nor trace of him. Why then such ceaseless pain<br />
To look a little longer on the sun,<br />

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">O, men, men!</span><br />

about Ardia's door. Guests enter, filling rear of hall,
and parapet. A maiden comes on, dancing the grain-dance
and scattering sesame. At the close of dance, Ardia's
maidens enter, each bearing a lighted candle which
she places on the altar. A Greek chant is heard as
priest approaches left. All wait his entrance, and the
curtain falls, rising again on the close of the ceremony.

<p><em>Bion.</em> Is all now done?</p>

<p><em>Priest.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">All's done. The spouse of Suli</span><br />
May bow herself unto her master's feet,<br />
Bespeaking so the love that has no wish<br />
But service, no desire save her lord's will.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>As Ardia would kneel, Bertrand prevents her</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> You shall not kneel.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">'Tis custom, dear my lord.</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Then here it dies.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">My mother did so much</span><br />
For him who made her wife.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Thy knees shall bend</span><br />
To God, and to none less. Reign at my side,<br />
Princess of Suli, not my feet.</p>

The bride of Suli!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Who speaks? And who</span><br />
Is traitor here?</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> Thou, foulest murderer!</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Who speaks?</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Dead Charilus.</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">'Tis Vigard's voice.</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<em>Vigard steps forth</em>]</span><br />
What, Vigard, art thou mad? Wouldst shatter the globe<br />
Of Heaven?</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, it was broken that same hour<br />
When died our father.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Son of Charilus, speak</span><br />
Your will. If you demand my life, 'tis yours.<br />
I hold it by your gentle lease and love.<br />
But while I ask not one poor breath for me,<br />
I beg you pause, nor cast the innocent<br />
To feed the vengeful and life-reaping fire<br />
Oswald will kindle for his hapless son.</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> You think no fires will burn but of his kindling?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> O shame! The crescent over Suli greets<br />
The cross on Kidmir!</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Ay, the crescent flies</span><br />
From Suli, thanks to faithful Moslem hands<br />
That set it there.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ah.... Moslem hands?</span></p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 12em;">You fool,</span><br />
To think that Oswald fluttered compliments,<br />
When he was dreaming how he'd bid you drink<br />
Of that same cup he gave to Charilus!</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> Now, dearest lady, you are safe. To-day<br />
The Faithful battled with the infidel,<br />
And that bright crescent is the silent sign<br />
We have the victory. Ramoor and Ilon<br />
With pointed sword bore down on either side<br />
The glutted, drunken army, while in front<br />
Avesta like a whirlwind swept&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">O, traitor!</span><br />
You vowed unbroken peace with Suli!</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Yea,</span><br />
Will keep it too, for I am Suli now.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> [<em>To her brothers</em>] Were you not sworn to Christ?</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">We are the Prophet's.</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> O, Heaven, hear not this! And Oswald's knights?</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> Sleep in Avesta's dungeons.</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Banissat,</span><br />
Avesta's golden prince, speak you the doom<br />
Of Bertrand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Doom? O&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Do not waste the breath</span><br />
A kiss may save. A thousand times, your lips!</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> [<em>To Biondel</em>] Let him not die!</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> You'll pray soon that he may!<br />
Speak, noble prince.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I, lord of conquered Suli,</span><br />
Condemn the son of Oswald unto death<br />
By crucifixion. Be his body nailed<br />
Upon the cross now raised on Kidmir peak,<br />
That Oswald may behold his groaning son,<br />
And every Christian dog look up and see<br />
How dies the Prophet's enemy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<em>To Ramunin</em>] Away!</span><br />
Prick him with delicate tortures that yet leave<br />
Him heart to heave his agony. Hear you!<br />
If he live not three days upon the cross<br />
Yourself shall hang beside him.</p>

<p><em>Ram.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I've a hand</span><br />
Has had some practice, sir.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">We know it, fellow,</span><br />
And therefore we employ you.</p>

<p><em>Ram.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I put the nails</span><br />
In young Deobus, he who hung five days<br />
'Twixt heaven and earth, and to the fifth eve groaned<br />
As he would pull his heart up. I've a medal<br />
Struck by the city for it.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I will match it,</span><br />
If you match me the service.</p>

<p><em>Ram.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">That I'll do.</span><br />
These English have strong hearts&mdash;will suck at pain<br />
As life were in her dugs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Exit Ramunin, guards, and Bertrand. Priest and guests
follow. The maidens huddle at door, right</em>]</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Sister, you stare</span><br />
Too hardly on this grief. It is a woe<br />
That Heaven smiles on, and the cure now waits<br />
In Banissat's fair mercy. You shall be<br />
His royal wife, and Suli's princess still.</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> Speak to the prince.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Nay, let her hear my vow.</span><br />
O, star of Kidmir, dear and beautiful,<br />
I'll set thee in a bosom that shall be<br />
A tender heaven round thee. Beat to earth<br />
Is murmurous suspicion, and again<br />
You shine unto the world, swept free of taint<br />
By noble marriage with most careful rites&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> I doubt, I doubt! One part, one point, one rite,<br />
Broken in act, left gaping and divided,<br />
One half performed, one half left all undone,<br />
Leaves me dishonored still. She is not widowed<br />
Who was not wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">All's done! What more canst wish?</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> To lay my forehead on my husband's feet,<br />
Which by the ancient custom of our house<br />
Is maidhood's closing act, as 'tis the first<br />
Of wifehood true. This thou wilt grant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 13em;">You're bound</span><br />
By rites enough!</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Canst stand uncertain on</span><br />
So slight a matter?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Slight? Ah, you know naught</span><br />
Of woman! Teach him, prince, that not a nick,<br />
Or turn, or shade of custom would she spare<br />
From this most holy ceremony. Wanting but<br />
The smallest portion that gives leave to say<br />
The measure lacks, she all her life will grieve,<br />
Shed secret tears, and wear a blanchen face<br />
When none knows why.</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">You shall not move us. Peace!</span></p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> A brawling fancy!</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Avesta's prince, thou who</span><br />
Shalt be my lord, if any lord of earth<br />
Be mine again, wouldst have my love, or hate?</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> Thy love, fair Ardia.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Then I pray you, sir,</span><br />
Move thy forbearance yet one farther step<br />
And pluck this boon for me. 'Tis near thy hand,<br />
And O, how small a thing for you to give,<br />
But as the sun of all my days to me!<br />
Without it I may die&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Speak not of death. So sweet</span><br />
I'll shelter thee, Death's self must bloom<br />
If he creep near thy bower.</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">May I, my lord,</span><br />
Keep honored place by thee when memory mocks<br />
That place and honor? Grant me this, but this,<br />
And here I swear if any act of man<br />
May move a widowed heart, mine shall grow warm<br />
To thee!</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> Do you speak truth?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Believe me, sir,</span><br />
So dear a thing is this for which I sue,<br />
That he who gives it must grow dear thereby;<br />
And if he lift to him my prostrate life,<br />
This gentle moment shall immortal be<br />
And sweeten every hour we pass together.<br />
Remembering this, my captive breast shall be<br />
His free dominion, and my lips on his,<br />
If they know warmth, shall take it from this cause,<br />
This first dear tenderness.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 7em;">We'll please you, mistress.</span><br />
Bring in the man again.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Exit a guard</em>]</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I beg you, prince&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> By Allah, she shall have her beggar wish,<br />
For no more reason than she wishes it!</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em> It is her sickish humor, sir, to look<br />
On him again. All this wild pother means<br />
No more than that.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> No more? We'll please her then<br />
For our good peace to come.</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 8em;">A princely kindness.</span></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<em>They talk together. Ardia crosses to altar</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Now one more miracle! God live in me,<br />

<p><em>Bion.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">What do you say,</span><br />
My sister?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> But a word to mine own heart.</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> Nay, mine now, is it not?</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 10em;">So much of it</span><br />
As dearest lenience may buy, my lord.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Bertrand is brought in guarded</em>]</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em> The man is here. Now have your foolish will.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<em>Ardia turns and looks at Bertrand. He is stripped of his
rich dress and wears only a girdled tunic falling to his
knees. Arms and feet are bare</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ban.</em> [<em>To Bertrand</em>] Sir, we permit the lady of our soul<br />
To end as her heart wills the rite that makes<br />
Her wife and widow. Touch her not, nor speak.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Bertrand crosses to altar</em>]</p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Why should we touch, when souls inhabit eyes<br />
And journey on a look? My heaven-lord,<br />
Here is no priest to bless this act of mine,<br />
But God will know his altar and the gift<br />
I lay upon it. The life we thought to live&mdash;<br />
That might have failed, and killed the dream now safe<br />
From tarnish of the days. Earth has enough<br />
Of blind and baffled lives, but great her need<br />
Of dreams. And ours we leave with her, unworn,<br />
Unpaled, warm round the love-seed she shall nurse<br />
To million-budded life.</p>

<p><em>Bion.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Come, make an end!</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> An end of love? The God of all the worlds<br />
Cannot do that. Love born this darkest day<br />
Shall be in flower on man's millennial path<br />
And touch his step with Heaven.</p>

<p><em>Vig.</em>  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Peace! Be done!</span></p>

<p><em>Ard.</em> Ay ... done. My lord, think thou art in the world<br />
Celestial, and from there smile on me&mdash;now&mdash;<br />

Your oaths!</p>

But I am weary, and my heavy stars<br />
Have left their skies to hang upon me here.<br />

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
